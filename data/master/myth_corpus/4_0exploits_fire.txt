ORIGINALLY fire was unknown to the inhabitants of this world, who of necessity ate raw food. In nether-world (Avaiki) lived four mighty ones : Mauike, god of fire ; the Sun-god Ra ; Ru, supporter of the heavens ; and lastly, his wife Buataranga, guardian of the road to the invisible world. To Ru and Buataranga was bora a famous son Maui. At an early age Maui was appointed one of the guardians of this upper world where mortals live. Like the rest of the inhabitants of the world, he subsisted on uncooked food. The mother, Buataranga, occasionally visited her son; but always ate her food apart, out of a basket brought with her from nether-land. One day, when she was asleep, Maui peeped into her basket and discovered cooked food. Upon tasting it, he 1 was decidedly of opinion that it was a great improvement upon the raw diet to which he was accustomed. This food came from nether-world; it was evident that the secret of fire was there. To nether-world, 52 Myths and Songs. the home of his parents, he would descend to gain this knowledge, so that ever after he might enjoy the luxury of cooked food On the following day Buataranga was about to descend to Avaiki (nether-world), when Maui followed her through the bush without her knowing it This was no difficult task, as she always came and returned by the same road. Peering through the tall reeds, he saw his mother standing opposite a black rock, which she addressed as follows Buataranga i tona rua, e rarangatu Buataranga, descend thou "bodily koe. through this chasm. E anuemie i akarongoia atu ei. The rainbow-like must be obeyed. Opipiri, 1 , Oeretue-i-te-ata e ! As two dark clouds parting at dawn, Vaia, vai akera. i te rua i Avaiki, nga Open, open up my road to nethertaae 1 world, ye fierce ones. At these words the rock divided, and Buataranga descended. Maui carefully treasured up these magic words; and without delay started off to see the god Tane, the owner of some wonderful pigeons. He earnestly begged Tane to lend him one ; but the proffered pigeon not pleasing Maui, was at once returned to its owner. A better pigeon was offered to the fastidious borrower, but was rejected. Nothing would content Maui but the possession of Akaotu, or Fearless, a red pigeon, specially prized by Tane. It was so tame that it knew its name; and, wander wherever it might, it was sure to return to its master. Tane, who was loth to part from his pet, extracted a promise from Maui that the pigeon should be restored to him uninjured. Maui now set off in high spirits, carrying with him his red pigeon, to the place where his mother had descended. Upon pronouncing the magic words which he had overheard, to his great delight the rock opened, and Maui, entering the pigeon, descended. Some assert 1 Names for the two clouds which are parted by the rising sun. The Exploits of Maui. 53 that Maui transformed himself into a small dragon-fly, and perched upon the back of the pigeon, made his descent The two fierce guardian demons of the chasm, enraged at finding themselves imposed upon by a stranger, made a grab at the pigeon, intending to devour it. Fortunately, however, for the borrower, they only succeeded in getting possession of the tail; whilst the pigeon, minus its beautiful tail, pursued its flight to the shades. Maui was grieved at the mishap which had overtaken the pet bird of his friend Tane. Arrived at nether-land, Maui sought for the home of his mother. It was the first house he saw : he was guided to it by the sound of her cloth-flail. The red pigeon alighted on an oven-house opposite to the open shed where Buataranga was beating out cloth. She stopped her work to gaze at the red pigeon, which she guessed to be a visitor from the upper world, as none of the pigeons in the shades were red. Buataranga said to the bird, "Are you not come from ' daylight?'" The pigeon nodded assent "Are you not my son Maui? " inquired the old woman. Again the pigeon nodded. At this Buataranga entered her dwelling, and the bird flew to a bread-fruit tree. Maui resumed his proper human form, and went to embrace his mother, who inquired how he had descended to nether-world, and the object of his visit Maui avowed that he had come to learn the secret of fire. Buataranga said, " This secret rests with the fire-god Mauike. When I wish to cook an oven, I ask your father Ru to beg a lighted stick from Mauike." Maui inquired where the fire-god lived. His mother pointed out the direction, and said it was called Are-aoa honse-of-banyan-sticks. She, entreated Maui to be careful, " for the fire-god is a terrible fellow, of a very irritable temper." Myths and Songs. Maui now walked up boldly towards the house of the fire-god, guided by the curling column of smoke, Mauike, who happened at the moment to be busy cooking an oven of food, stopped his work and demanded what the stranger wanted. Maui replied, "A fire-brand." The fire-brand was given. Maui carried it to a stream running past the bread-fruit tree and there extinguished it He now returned to Mauike and obtained a second fire-brand, which he also extinguished in the streamThe third time a lighted stick was demanded of the fire-god, he was beside himself with rage. Raking the ashes of his oven, he gave the daring Maui some of them on a piece of dry wood. These live coals were thrown into the stream as the former lighted sticks had been. Maui correctly thought that a fire-brand would be of little use unless he could obtain the secret of fire. The brand would eventually go out; but how to reproduce the fire 1 His object therefore was to pick a quarrel with the fire-god, and compel him by sheer violence to yield up the invaluable secret, as yet known to none but himself. On the other hand, the fire-god, confident in his own prodigious strength, resolved to destroy this insolent intruder into his secret Maui for the fourth time demanded fire of the enraged fire-god. Mauike ordered him away, under pain of being tossed into the air ; for Maui was small of stature. But the visitor said he should enjoy nothing better than a trial of strength with the fire-god. Mauike entered his dwelling to put on his war-girdle (ume i tona maro) ; but on returning found that Maui had swelled himself to an enormous size. Nothing daunted at this, Mauike boldly seized him with both hands and hurled him to the height of a cocoa-nut tree. Maui contrived in falling to make himself so light that he was in no degree hurt by his adventure. Mauike, maddened that his adversary should yet breathe, The Exploits of Mam. 55 exerted his full strength, and next time hurled him far higher than the highest cocoa-nut tree that ever grew. Yet Maui was uninjured by his fall ; whilst the fire-god lay panting for breath. It was now Maui's turn. Seizing the fire-god he threw him up to a dizzy height, and caught him again like a ball with his hands. Without allowing Mauike to touch the ground, he threw him a second time into the air, and caught him in his hands. Assured that this was but a preparation for a final toss which would seal his fate, the panting and thoroughly exhausted Mauike entreated Maui to stop and to spare his life. Whatever he desired should be his. The fire-god, now in a miserable plight, was allowed to breathe awhile. Maui said, " Only on one condition will I spare you -,tett me the secret of fire. Where is it hidden t How is it froduced? " Mauike gladly promised to tell him all he knew, and led him inside his wonderful dwelling. In one corner there was a quantity of fine cocoa-nut fibre; in another, bundles of fireyielding sticks the "a^," 1 the "oronga," 2 the "tauinu]' and particularly the "000," 3 or banyan tree. These sticks were all dry and ready for use. In the middle of the room were two smaller sticks by themselves. One of these the fire-god gave to Maui, desiring him to hold it firmly, while he himself plied the other most vigorously. And thus runs THE FIRE-GOD'S SONG. Ika, ika i taku ai e ! Grant, oil grant me thy hidden fire, Te aoaoaoa. Thou banyan tree ! 1 The lemon hibiscus. 2 Urtica argentea. s Ficus Indicus. 5 6 Myths and Songs. Tutuki i te pupu ; Perform an incantation ; Ka ai i te karakia. Utter a prayer to (the spirit of) Te aoaoaoa. The banyan tree ! Kia ka te ai a Mauike Kindle a fire for Mauike I nunga i te papanga aoa e ! Of the dust of the banyan tree ! By the time this song was completed, Maui to his great joy perceived a faint smoke arising out of the fine dust produced by the friction of one stick upon another. As they persevered in their work the smoke increased j and, favoured with the fire-god's breath, a slight flame arose, when the fine cocoa-nut fibre was called into requisition to catch and increase the flame. Mauike now called to his aid the different bundles of sticks, and speedily got up a blazing fire, to the astonishment of Maui. The grand secret of fire was secured But the victor resolved to be revenged for his trouble and his tossing in the air, by setting fire to his fallen adversary's abode. In a short time all netherworld was in flames, which consumed the fire-god and all he possessed. Even the rocks cracked and split with the heat : hence the ancient saying, " The rocks at Orovaru * (in the shades) are burning." Ere leaving the land of ghosts, Maui carefully picked up the two fire-sticks, once the property of Mauike, and hastened to the bread-fruit tree, where the red pigeon " Fearless " quietly awaited his return. His first care was to restore the tail of the bird, so as to avoid the anger of Tane. There was no time to be lost, for the flames were rapidly spreading. He re-entered the pigeon, which carried his fire-sticks one in each claw, and flew to the lower entrance of the chasm. Once more pronouncing the words he learnt from Buataranga, the rocks parted, and he safely got back 1 Equivalent to saying, " The foundations of the earth are on fire." The Exploits of Maui. 57 to this upper world. Through the good offices of his mother the pigeon met with no opposition from the fierce guardians of the road to the shades. On again entering into light the red pigeon took a long sweep, alighting eventually in a lovely secluded valley, which was thenceforth named Rupe-tau, or the pigeori s-restingplace. Maui now resumed his original human form, and hastened to carry back the pet bird of Tane. Passing through the main valley of Keia, he found that the flames had preceded him, and had found an aperture at Teaoa, since closed up. The kings Rangi and Mokoiro trembled for their land ; for it seemed as if everything would be destroyed by the devouring flames. To save Mangaia from utter destruction, they exerted themselves to the utmost, and finally succeeded in putting out the fire. Rangi thenceforth adopted the new name of Matamea, or Watery-eyes, to commemorate his sufferings; and Mokoiro was ever after called Auai, or Smoke. The inhabitants of Mangaia availed themselves of the conflagration to get fire and to cook food. But after a time the fire went out, and as they were not in possession of the secret, they could not get new fire. But Maui was never without fire in his dwelling : a circumstance that excited the surprise of all. Many were the inquiries as to the cause. At length he took compassion on the inhabitants of the world, and told them the wonderful secretthat fire lies hidden in the hibiscus, the urtica argentea, the "-tauinu," and the banyan. This hidden fire might be elicited by the use of firesticks, which he produced. Finally, he desired them to chant the fire-god j s song, to give efficacy to the use of the fire-sticks. From that memorable day all the dwellers in this upper world used fire-sticks with success, and enjoyed the luxuries of light and cooked food. 58 Myths and Songs. nr " "" To the present time this primitive method of obtaining fire is still in vogue; cotton, however, being substituted for fine cocoa-nut fibre as tinder. It was formerly supposed that only the four kinds of wood found in the fire-god's dwelling would yield fire. "Aoa" means banyan-tree; for intensity and for rhythm the word is lengthened into "aoaoaoa." The banyan was sacred to the fire-god. The spot where the flames are said to have burst through, named Te-aoa, or the the-banyan-tree, was sacred until Christianity induced the owner to convert the waste land into a couple of excellent taro patches. Often when listening to the story of this Polynesian Prometheus, the question has been proposed to me, "Who taught your ancestors the art of kindling fire ? " At Rarotonga Buataranga becomes Ataranga; at Samoa Talanga. In the Samoan dialect Mauike becomes Mafuie. THE SKY RAISED ; OR, THE ORIGIN OF PUMICE STONE. The sky is built of solid blue stone. At one time it almost touched the earth ; resting upon the stout broad leaves of the tew (which attains the height of about six feet) and the delicate indigenous arrow-root (whose slender stem rarely exceeds three feet). The unique flattened-but form of these leaves, like millions of outspread hands pressing upwards, is the result of having to sustain this enormous weight In this narrow space between earth and sky the inhabitants of this world were pent up. Ru ? whose usual residence was in Avaiki, or the shades, had come up The Exploits of Mam. 59 for a time to this world of ours. Pitying the wretched confined residence of its inhabitants, he very laudably employed himself in endeavouring to raise the sky a little. For this purpose he cut a number of strong stakes of different kinds of trees, and firmly planted them in the ground at Rangimotia, the centre of the island and of the world. This was a considerable improvement, as mortals were thereby enabled to stand erect and to walk about without inconvenience. Hence Ru was named "The sky-supporter." Wherefore Teka sings (1794) : Tuperetuki i te rangi, Force up the sky, Ru, E Ru e, ua mareva. And let the space be clear ! One day, when the old man was surveying his work, his graceless son Maui contemptuously asked him what he was doing there. Ru replied, "Who told youngsters to talk? Take care of yourself, or I will hurl you out of existence." " Do it then," shouted Maui. Ru was as good as his word, and forthwith seized Maui, who was small of stature, and threw him to a great height In falling Maui assumed the form of a bird, and lightly touched the ground perfectly unharmed. Maui, now thirsting for revenge, in a moment resumed his natural form, but exaggerated to gigantic proportions, and ran to his father saying : Ru tokotoko i te rangi tuatini, Ru, who supports the many heavens Tuatoru, ka ruatiaraurau 1 The third, even to the highest, ascend 1 Inserting his head between the old man's legs, he exerted all his prodigious strength, and hurled poor Ru, sky and all, to a tremendous height so high, indeed, that the azure sky could never get back again. Unluckily, however, for " the-sky-supporting-Ru," his head and shoulders got entangled among the stars. He struggled hard, but fruitlessly, to extricate himself. Maui walked oif well 60 Myths and Songs. pleased with having raised the sky to its present height ; but left half his father's body and both his legs ingloriously suspended between heaven and earth. Thus perished Ru. His body rotted away, and his bones, of vast proportions, came tumbling down from time to time, and were shivered on the earth into countless fragments. These shivered "bones of Ru" are scattered over every hill and valley of Mangaia, to the very edge of the sea. " The district " (said my narrator) " where Ru's bones are supposed to have fallen is on the northern part of the island, and derives its name from this circumstance. It belongs to me." It is true that what is universally known in these islands as " the bones of Ru " (te ivi o Ru), is found all over the island in small quantities. Upon repeated careful examinations these " bones " proved to be common pumice stone. The largest " bone " I have ever seen on the island is about the size of a man's fist The peculiar lightness and bonelike appearance of pumice stone doubtless suggested the idea that it was the veritable remains of a famous hero of antiquity. The younger natives now know pretty well the volcanic origin of these mythical " bones." In 1862, when at Pukapuka, or Danger Island, where two years afterwards the first John Williams was wrecked, the natives brought me a large collection of idols of secondary rank. They piled them up in a heap before me. My curiosity was aroused by seeing an old man, formerly a priest, carrying what seemed to be a large lump of coal with evident ease. Upon carefully looking at it, this god proved to be merely pumice stone blackened by long exposure to rain and wind. Of course it had drifted from some other island. It was known as Ko te toka mama i.e. the-light-stone, and was regarded as the god The Exploits of Maid. 61 of the wind and the waves. Upon occasions of a hurricane, incantations and offerings of food would be made to it. Such worship will be made no more ; for it is now deposited with the other gods in the museum of the University of Sydney. Purnice stone was not regarded as being sacred in the Hervey Group. THE SUN MADE CAPTIVE. Maui had secured fire for the advantage of mortals, had elevated the sky ; but there remained one great evil to be remedied the sun had a trick of setting every now and then, so that it was impossible to get through any work. Even an oven of food could not be prepared and cooked before the sun had set. Nor could a "karakia," or incantation to the gods, be chanted through ere they were overtaken by darkness. Maui resolved to remove this great evil. Now Ra, or the Sun, is a living creature and divine; in form resembling a man, and possessed of fearful energy. His golden locks are displayed morning and evening to mankind. Buataranga advised her son not to have anything to do with Ra, or the Sun, as many had at different times endeavoured to regulate his movements, and had all signally failed. But the redoubtable Maui was not to be discouraged. He resolved to capture the Sun-god Ra, and compel him to obey the dictates of his conqueror. Maui now carefully plaited six great ropes of strong cocoa-nut fibre, each composed of four strands, and of a great length. These wonderful cords of his were named by the inventor Aei-ariki r t\e. royal nooses. Maui started off with his ropes to the distant aperture through which the Sun climbs up from Avaiki, or 1 = Taei-ariki. 62 Myths and Songs. the land of ghosts, into the heavens, and there laid a slip-noose for him. Further on in the Sun's path a second trap was laid. In fact, all the six ropes were placed at distant intervals along the accustomed route of Ra, or the Sun. Very early in the morning the unsuspecting Sun clambered up from Avaiki to perform his usual journey through the heavens. Maui was lying in wait near the first " royal noose," and exultingly pulled it ; but it slipped down the Sun's body, and only caught his feet. Maui ran forward to look after the second noose, but that likewise slipped. Luckily, however, it closed round the Sun's knees. The third caught him round the hips; the fourth, round the waist; the fifth, under the arms. Still the Sun went tearing on his path, scarcely heeding the contrivances of Maui. But happily for Maui's designs, the sixth and last of the " royal nooses " caught the Sun round the neck I Ra, or the Sun, now terribly frightened, struggled hard for his liberty, but to no purpose. For Maui pulled the rope so tight as almost to strangle the Sun, and then fastened the end of his rope to a point of rock. Ra, or the Sun, now nearly dead, confessed himself to be vanquished j and fearing for his life, gladly agreed to the demand of Maui, that in future he should be a little more reasonable and deliberate in his movements through the heavens, so as to enable the inhabitants of this world to get through their employments with ease. The Sun-god Ra was now allowed to proceed on his way ; but Maui wisely declined to take off these ropes, wishing to keep Ra in constant fear. These ropes may still be seen hanging from the Sun at dawn, and when he descends into the ocean at night. By the assistance of these ropes he is gently let down into Avaiki, and in the morning is raised up out of the shades. The Exploits of Mam. 63 Of course this extravagant myth refers to what English children call "the sun drawing up water;" or, as these islanders still say, " Tena te taura a Maui ! " = " Behold the ropes of Maui ! It is interesting to note that the great Polynesian name for the Sun-god is Ra, as was the case in ancient Egypt entering into the composition of the regal title "Pharaoh," etc. The rule of each great temporal sovereign was indifferently called a " mangaia"* = peaceful reign, or a "koina-ra" = bright shining of the sun, the sovereign chief, of course, being the sun. Sometimes he was called " the man who holds the Ra (sun) j " at other times "the Sun(Ra)-eater." At death, or the transference of the supreme temporal power, it was naturally said, " the Ra has set." Ra was the tutelary god of Borabora. Such are the three great achievements of Maui. Nothing more is related of him in the Hervey Group, save that he was driven away by Rangi for setting the rocks on fire. A husband is lovingly called by his wife her " rua-ra " = sunhole, in allusion to the preceding myth, as from him comes the light of her life. The husband gallantly calls the wife his " are-rau," well-thatched house, where his affections repose. These are standard expressions in hourly use. THE WISDOM OF MANIHIKP (KORERO MANIHIKI). On the island of Rarotonga once lived Manuahifare and his wife Tongoifare, offspring of the god Tangaroa. Their eldest son was named Maui the First, the next Maui the Second. Then fol1 Manihiki, Rakaanga, and Tongareva are situated about 600 miles north of Rarotonga. 64 Myths and Songs. lowed their sister Inaika Ina4Ju-Fish. The youngest was a boy, Maui the Third. Like all other young Polynesians, these children delighted in the game of hide-and-seek. One day Inaika hid her pet brother, Maui the Third, under a pile of dry sticks and leaves, and then desired the elder boys to search for him. They sought everywhere in vain. Inaika at last pointed to the pile, and naturally expected to see her little brother emerge from his hidingplace, as the sticks were scattered to the right and left. The heap had disappeared, but no Maui was to be seen, What had become of him ? But after a few minutes they were astonished to see him start up from under a few bits of decayed wood and some leaves which had been thoroughly searched a few seconds before. This was the first intimation of Maui the Third's future greatness. This wonderful lad had noticed that his father, Manuahifare, mysteriously disappeared at dawn of every day ; and in an equally mysterious way came back again to their dwelling at night He resolved to discover this secret, which seemed to him the more strange as, being the favourite, he slept by the side of Manuahifare, and yet never knew when or how he disappeared. One night he lay awake until his father unfastened his girdle in order to sleep. Very cautiously did Maui, the Younger, take up one end and place it under himself, without attracting his father's notice. Early next morning, this precocious son was roused from his slumbers by the girdle being pulled from under him. This was just as he desired ; he lay perfectly still, to see what would become of Manuahifare. The unsuspecting parent went, as he was wont, to the main pillar of his dwelling, and said O pillar I open, open up, That Manuahifare may enter and descend to netherworld (Avaiki). The pillar immediately opened, and Manuahifare descended. The Exploits of Mam. 65 That same day the four children of Manuahifare went back to their old game of hide-and-seek. This time Maui the Younger told his brothers and sister to go outside the house, whilst he should look out for some place to hide in. As soon as they were out of sight, he went up to the post through which his father had disappeared, and pronounced the magic words he had overheard. To his great joy the obedient post opened up, and Maui boldly descended to the nether regions. Manuahifare was greatly surprised to see his son down there; but after saluting (literally, " smelling ") him, quietly proceeded with his work. Maui the Third went on an exploring tour through these unknown subterranean regions, the entrance to which he had luckily discovered. Amongst other wonderful things, he fell in with a blind old woman bending over a fire where her food was being cooked. In her hand she held a pair of tongs (i.e. a green cocoa-nut midrib, split open). Every now and then she carefully took up a live coal, and placed it on one side, supposing it to be food, whilst the real food was left to burn to cinder in the fire 1 Maui inquired her name, and, to his surprise, found it was Inaporari, or Ina-the-Blind, his own grandmother. The clever grandson heartily pitied the condition of the poor old creature, but would not reveal his own name. Close to where he stood watching the futile cooking of Ina-the-Blind grew four nono trees (morindo citrifolia). Taking up a stick, he gently struck the nearest of the four trees. Ina-the-Blind angrily said, "Who is that meddling with the nono belonging to Maui the Elder?" The bold visitor to nether-world then walked up to the next tree and tapped it gently. Again the ire of Ina-the-Blind was excited, and she shouted, "Who is this meddling with the nono of Maui the Second ? " The audacious boy struck a third tree, and found it 66 Myths and Songs. belonged to his sister Inaika. He now exultingly tapped the fourth and last nono tree, and heard his old grandmother ask, "Who is this meddling with the nono of Maui the Third?" "/ am Maui the Third? said the visitor. "Then," said she, " you are my grandson, and this is your own tree." Now when Maui first looked at his own nono tree, it was entirely destitute of leaves and fruit ; but after Ina-the-Blind had spoken to him, he again looked and was surprised to see it covered with glossy leaves and fine apples, though not ripe. Maui climbed up into the tree, and plucked one of the apples. Biting off a piece of it, he stepped up to his grandmother and threw it into one of her blind eyes. The pain was excruciating, but sight was at once restored to the eye which had so long been blind. Maui plucked another apple, and biting off a piece of it, threw it into the other eye of his grandmother and lo ! sight was restored to it also. Ina-the-Blind was delighted to see again, and, in gratitude, said to her grandson, "All above, and all below"(= all on earth and all in spirit-land) "are subject to tliee, and to thee only." Ina, once called the-Blind, now instructed Maui in all things found within her territory; that as there were four species of nono, so there are four varieties of cocoa-nuts and four of taro in Avaiki, Le. one for each child of Manuahifare, Maui asked Ina, " Who is lord of fire ? " She replied, " Thy grandfather Tangaroa-tui-mata," (or Tangaroa-of-the-tattooed-face}* " Where is he ? " inquired MauL " Yonder," rejoined his grandmother ; "but do not go to him. He is a terribly irritable fellow : you will surely perish." But as Maui persisted, the grateful goddess Ina said, " There are two roads to his dwelling. One of these is the path of death; whoever unwittingly approaches the The Exploits of Mam. 67 Great Tangaroa by this path, dies. The other is the ' common,' or * safe J (noa) road." Maui disdained to choose the path of safety. Knowing his own prowess, he boldly trod the path of death. Tangaroa-of-the-tattooed-face, seeing Maui advancing, raised his right hand to kill him that hand which as yet had never failed to destroy its victim. But Maui, nothing daunted, lifted his right hand. At this Tangaroa, not liking the aspect of Maui, raised his right foot, for the purpose of kicking to death the luckless intruder. But Maui was prepared to do the same to the lord of fire with his right foot Astounded at this piece of audacity, Tangaroa demanded his name. The visitor replied, " I am Maui the Younger." The god now knew it to be his own grandson. " What did you come for ? " " To get fire," was the response of Maui. Tangaroa-of-the-tattooed-face gave him a lighted stick, and sent him away. Maui walked to a short distance, and finding some water, like that dividing the two islets collectively called Manihiki, extinguished the lighted stick. Three times this process was repeated. The fourth time all the firebrands were gone, and Tangaroa had to fetch two dry sticks to rub together, in order to produce fire, Maui held the under one for his grandfather ; but just as the fine dust in the groove was igniting, the impudent Maui blew it all away. Tangaroa, justly irritated at this, drove Maui away, and summoned a "kakaia," or tern, to come to his assistance to hold down the lower piece of wood, whilst Tangaroa diligently worked again with the other stick. At last, to the infinite joy of Maui, fire was obtained. It was no longer a mystery. Maui suddenly snatched the upper stick, one end of which was burning, out of the hand of Tangaroa. The patient bird of white plumage still firmly clutched with her daws the under fire-stick, when Maui purposely burnt either side of the 68 Myths and Songs. eye of the bird The indignant tern, smarting at this ill-requital, fled away for ever. Hence the black marks, resembling a pair of eyebrows, on either side of the eye of this beautiful bird to this day. Tangaroa reproached his grandson with having thus wantonly deprived him of the valuable services of his favourite bird. Maui deceitfully said, " Your bird will come back." Maui next proposed to Tangaroa that they should both fly up to day-light through the hole by which the bird had escaped The god inquired how this could be accomplished. Maui at once volunteered to show the way, and actually flew to a considerable height like a bird Tangaroa-of-the-tattooed-face was greatly delighted. Maui came down to the ground, and urged his grandfather to imitate his example. " Nothing," said Maui, " is easier than to fly." At his grandson's suggestion, Tangaroa put on his glorious girdle^ by mortals called the rainbow, and, to his immense delight, succeeded in rising above the loftiest cocoa-nut tree. The crafty Maui took care to fly lower than Tangaroa, and getting hold of one end of the old man's girdle, he gave it a smart pull, which brought down poor Tangaroa from his giddy elevation. The fall killed Great Tangaroa. Pleased with his achievement in getting the secret of fire from his grandfather and then killing him, he returned to his parents, who had both descended to nether-land. Maui told them he had got the secret of fire, but withheld the important circumstance that he had killed Tangaroa. His parents expressed their joy at his success, and intimated their wish to go and pay their respects to the Supreme Tangaroa. Maui objected to their going at once. " Go," said he, " on the third day. I wish to go myself to-morrow." The parents of Maui acquiesced in this arrangement Accordingly, on the next day Maui went to the abode of Tangaroa, The Exploits of Maui. 69 and found the body entirely decomposed. He carefully collected the bones, put them inside a cocoa-nut shell, carefully closed the tiny aperture, and finally gave them a thorough shaking. Upon opening the cocoa-nut shell, he found his grandfather to be alive again. Liberating the divinity from his degrading imprisonment, he carefully washed him, anointed him with sweet-scented oil, fed him, and then left him to recover strength in his own dwelling. Maui now returned to his parents Manuahifare and Tongoifare, and found them very urgent to see Tangaroa, Again Maui said, "Wait till to-morrow." The fact was, he greatly feared their displeasure, and had secretly resolved to make his way back to the upper world he had formerly inhabited whilst his parents were on their visit to Tangaroa. Upon visiting the god on the morning of the third day, Manuahifare and Tongoifare were greatly shocked to find that he had entirely lost his old proud bearing, and that on his face were the marks of severe treatment. Manuahifare asked his father Tangaroa the cause of this. " Oh," said the god, " your terrible boy has been here ill-treating me. He killed me; then collected my bones, and rattled them about in an empty cocoa-nut shell ; he then finally made me live again, scarred and enfeebled, as you see. Alas ! that fierce son of yours." The parents of Maui wept at this, and forthwith came back to the old place in Avaiki in quest of their son, intending to scold him well. But he had made his escape to the upper world, where he found his two brothers and his sister Inaika in mourning for him whom they never expected to see again. Maui the Third told them that he had made a grand discovery he had obtained the secret of fire. He had found a new land. Myths and Songs. -Where is it situated?" inquired they. "Down there" saic Maui the Younger. Down where 1 they demanded. "Dowr tore* again shouted Maui. The fact was, they were not aware o the secret opening in their house leading to Avaiki. At the earnest solicitation of Maui, they all consented to follow him Accordingly, he went to the old post of their dwelling, and saic as before : pillar ! open, open up, That we all may enter and descend to nether-world. At these words the wonderful pillar at once opened, and all foui descended Maui showed them all the wonders of spirit-world, and when at length their curiosity was perfectly satisfied, he conducted them back to the upper world of light, to which they all properly belonged. MAUI ENSLAVING THE SUN. Food was now cooked by the inhabitants of this upper world, whereas formerly it was eaten raw. But the Sun-god Ra used to set in mad haste, ere the family oven could be properly cooked. Maui considered how he could remedy this great evil. A strong rope of cocoa-nut fibre was made and laid round the aperture by which the Sun-god climbed up from Avaiki (nether-world). But it was in vain. Still stronger ropes were made; but all to no purpose. Maui fortunately bethought himself of his beloved sister's hair, which was remarkably long and beautiful. He cut off some of Inaika's locks and plaited it into rope, placed it round the aperture, and then hid himself. The moment the Sun-god Ra emerged from spirit-world in the east, Maui quickly pulled one end of the cord and caught him round the throat with the slipThe Exploits of Maui. 71 knot. The hitherto unmanageable monster bellowed and writhed in his vain efforts to extricate himself. Almost at the last gasp, he begged Maui to release him on any terms he pleased. The victorious Maui said that if he would pledge himself to go on his course at a more reasonable rate, he should be released. The promise was readily given by the trembling captive, and hence it is that ever since the inhabitants of this upper world have enjoyed sufficient sunlight to complete the duties of the day. THE SKY RAISED. Originally the heavens almost touched the earth. Maui resolved to elevate the sky, and fortunately succeeded in obtaining the assistance of Ru. Maui stationed himself at the north, whilst Ru took up his position in the south. Prostrate on the ground, at a given signal they succeeded in raising a little with their backs the solid blue mass. Now pausing awhile on their knees, they gave it a second lift Maui and Ru were now able to stand upright \ with their shoulders they raised the sky higher still. The falms of their hands, and then the tip of their fingers^ enabled these brave fellows to elevate it higher and higher. Finally, drawing themselves out to gigantic proportions, they pushed the entire heavens up to the very lofty position which they have ever since occupied. v But the work was not complete, for the surface of the sky was very irregular. Maui and Ru got a large stone adze apiece, and therewith chipped off the roughest parts of the sky, thus giving it a perfectly oval appearance. They now procured superior adzes, in order to finish off the work so auspiciously commenced. Maui and Ru did not cease to chip, chip, chip at the blue vault, until it became faultlessly smooth and beautiful, as we see it now I Myths and Songs. HAITI'S LAST AND GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT. A native of Rarotonga, named Iku, was a noted fisherman. He was accustomed to go out to sea a great distance, and yet safely find his way back with abundance of fish. The obvious reason of this was that Iku knew the names and movements of the stars \ and by them he steered his course at night. Upon one occasion this Rarotongan fisherman, at a great distance from his home, discovered a vast block of stone at the bottom of the ocean. This was the island of Manihiki. Iku made sail for Rarotonga to tell what he had seen. The three brothers Maui heard Iku tell his story of this submarine island, and determined to get possession of it for themselves. Accordingly, without giving the discoverer the slightest hint of their intentions, they sailed in a large canoe to the north (a distance of 600 miles) in quest of the sunken island. Many days passed in weary search, ere they were rewarded with a sight of the great block of coral at the bottom of the sea. Maui the Elder now baited his large hook with a piece of raw fish, and let it down. The bait took; and Maui the Elder pulled hard at the line. As the fish drew near the surface, he asked his brother whether it was a shark or a kakai. They pronounced it to be a kakai. Maui the Second next baited his hook, and like his brother caught only a kakai. It was now Maui the Younger^ turn to try his luck. He selected as bait the young bud x of the cocoa-nut, which he had brought with him for the purpose. This he wrapped up in a leaf 1 The size of a filbert. The Exploits of Maui. 73 of the laurel tree. A very strong line was attached to the hook, and then let down. Maui soon found that he had got hold of something very heavy, and he in his turn asked his brothers what sort of fish was on his hook. They sapiently assured him that " it was either a shark or a kakai." Maui found his prize to be intolerably heavy, so he put forth all his hidden strength, and up came the entire island of Manihiki ! As the island neared the surface, the canoe in which the three brothers were, broke in two with the mighty straining of Maui the Younger. His two brothers were precipitated into the ocean and drowned. Luckily for Maui the Younger, one of his feet rested on the solid coral of the ascending island. At length Manihiki rose high and dry above the breakers, drawn up from the ocean depths by the exertions of the now solitary Maui. Maui surveyed his island possession with great satisfaction, for this he regarded as his crowning achievement. There was, however, one serious defect, there was no canoe passage. Maui at once set to work upon a part of the reef, and made the excellent opening for canoes which distinguishes Manihiki above many other islands. Not long afterwards Iku came back to his favourite fishingground. Great was his surprise and indignation to find Manihiki raised up from the ocean depths by the eiforts of Maui, and already inhabited by him. Iku resolved to slay Maui for doing this. He got ashore at the passage which his adversary had so conveniently made, and fought with Maui* In this fight Maui retreated to a certain spot, stamped his foot with great violence, and so broke off a part of what now constitutes one extremity of the sister islet of Rakaanga. Iku feared not this exhibition of the prowess of Maui, and 74 Myths and Songs. again pursued him with intent to kill him. Maui now ran to the opposite side of Manihiki, and again violently stamped the earth with his foot; and thus it was that the originally large island of Manihiki was cleft into two equal parts, one of which retains the ancient designation Manihiki, the other is called Rakaanga. A wide ocean channel (of twenty-five miles) separates these twin coral islands. Finally, Maui ascended "up into the heavens and was seen no more. On the island of Rakaanga visitors are shown a hollow in a rock near the sea, closely resembling a human foot-print of the ordinary size. This is called the footprint of Maui? where his right foot rested when the canoe parted, and he had almost sunk in the ocean. Close by is a hole in the coral, said to be the place where Main's fish-hook held fast when he pulled up the island from the bottom of the ocean. It is asserted that Maui carried with him to the skies the great fish-hook employed by him on that occasion. The tail of the constellation " Scorpio " is to this day called by the natives of Manihiki and Rakaanga " the fish-hook of Maui? Iku lived alone on Manihiki for a time. One day he saw a cocoa-nut floating on the surface of the ocean. He brought it ashore, and then planted it. Thus grew the first cocoa-nut tree on Manihiki. Iku returned to Rarotonga to fetch his sister Tapairu and her husband Toa, All three safely reached Manihiki and settled down in their new-found home. Five daughters were born to Toa ; but no son was given to him until he married his youngest daughter. From Toa and Tapairu, a single family, all the present inhabitants of Manihiki and Rakaanga are descended. In after The Exploits of Mam. 75 times Mahuta and his clan migrated to Penrhyns; thus the Penrhyn Islanders, the natives of Manihiki and Rakaanga, are all descended from the Rarotongan Toa and his wife Tapairu. Such is "the wisdom of Manihiki." Few myths are so complete, and few islanders have been so free from foreign admixture as the natives of Manihiki and Rakaanga. They wonderfully resemble each other ; so that to have seen one Manihikian is to have seen all A close parallel runs between their version of the exploits of of Main and that which obtains elsewhere. Some particulars are wholly dissimilar; for instance, I can find no account of " the tones of Ru." Mangaian tradition represents Maui as being driven away by Rangi to Rarotonga, for setting the island on fire. The " wisdom of Manihiki " represents Maui as living at Rarotonga, and starting thence on his wonderful voyage in search of Manihiki. The tail of " Scorpio " is on Mangaia known as " the great fishhook of Tongareva? i.e. Penrhyns. The myth respecting it is similar to the preceding, but refers to Tongareva, or Penrhyns, not to Manihiki. Vatea takes the place of Maui. The story of Toa and Tapairu is simple history, well known at Rarotonga. That Mahuta, accompanied by his wife Tavai, emigrated to the hitherto uninhabited island of Penrhyns is undoubted truth. A second canoe, piloted by the son of the renowned Mahuta, followed and succeeded in making that extensive but most barren of islands, Tongareva. In July, 1871, I visited Rakaanga. We rowed in a flat76 Myths and Songs. bottomed boat without a keel, built of cocoa-nut timber neatly sewn togetJier with cinet Yet these adventurous islanders think nothing of traversing the twenty-five miles of ocean between Rakaanga and Manihiki in such frail barks. The king pointed out to us the foot-print of Maui, and the rock in which his fish-hook caught. He next took us to the uninhabited islet (where now they keep their pigs), to show us the ancient road to spirit-land. We could perceive no hole or special depression in the ground ; but were assured that, if we dug deep enough, we should be sure to find it Maui once, standing upon this spot, overheard a confused murmuring of voices beneath. In a low voice he inquired who these imprisoned spirits were. Those underneath shouted out their names in the form of a song, which our guide repeated. Said he, " Our fathers assured us there they still are ; only earth has been piled upon the aperture." These spirits are said to be " like soldier crabs, boring down and hiding in the bowels of the earth." ( 77 ) CHAPTER V. TREE MYTHS. THE MYTH OF THE COCOA-NUT TREE. iNA-MOE-Arru, 1 or Ina-wJw-had-a-divme-lover, daughter of Kui-theBlind, once dwelt at Tamarua, under the frowning shadow of the cave of Tautua, so like the entrance of a gigantic edifice. A sluggish stream, abounding in eels, ran near her dwelling, and finally disappeared beneath the rocks. At dawn and sunset Ina loved to bathe near a clump of trees. On one occasion an enormous eel crept up the stream from its natural hiding-place under the rocks, and startled her by its touch. Again and again this occurred; so that Ina became in a measure accustomed to its presence. To her surprise one day, as she fixed her eyes upon the eel, its form changed, and the fish assumed the appearance of a handsome youth, who said to Ina, " I am Tuna (eel), the god and protector of all fresh-water eels. Smitten by your beauty, I left my gloomy home to win your love. Be mine." From that day he became her attached admirer in his human form, always resuming the eel shape upon his return to his proper haunts, so as to elude notice. Some time after he took his farewell of the 1 Aitu = god. 78 Myths and Songs. lovely Ina. " We must part," said Tuna ; " but, as a memorial of our attachment, I will bestow on you a great boon. To-morrow there will be a mighty rain, flooding the entire valley. Be not afraid, as it will enable me to approach your house on yon rising ground in my eel form. I will lay my head upon the wooden threshold. At once cut it off, and bury it : be sure daily to visit the spot to see what will come of it." Ina saw no more of her handsome lover ; but was that night roused from sleep by rain falling in torrents. Remembering Tuna's words, she remained quietly in her dwelling until daylight, when she found that the water, streaming down from the hills, had covered the taro-patches, and had risen close to the entrance to her hut. At this moment a great eel approached her, and laid its head upon her threshold. Ina ran to fetch her axe, and forthwith chopped off the head, and buried it at the back of her hut on the hill-side. The rain ceased, and in the course of a day or two the waters were drained off by the natural passage under the rocks the true home of Tuna. According to her promise to her lover, Ina daily visited the spot where the enormous eel's head was buried ; but for many days saw nothing worthy of notice. At last she was delighted to find a stout green shoot piercing the soil. Next day the shoot had divided into two. The twin shoots, thus gradually unfolding themselves, were very different from other plants. They grew to maturity, and sent forth great leaves, exciting the wonder of all. After the lapse of years flowers and fruit appeared. Of these twin cocoa-nut trees, sprung from the two halves of Tuna's brains, one was red in stem, branches, and fruit; whilst the other was of a deep green. And thus came into existence the two principal varieties of the cocoa-nut; the red being sacred to Tangaroa, and Tree Myths. 79 the green to Rongo. In proof of its being derived from the head of Tuna, when husked on each nut is invariably found the two eyes and mouth of the lover of Ina. The white kernel of the cocoa-nut is commonly called "te roro o Tuna," or the brains of Tuna. In heathenism it was unlawful for women to eat eels; and to this day they mostly turn away from this fish with the utmost disgust The extremity of a great cocoa-nut leaf, termed the " iku kikau," and comprising ten or twelve lesser 'leaves, when cut off and neatly bound with a bit of yellow cinet by " the priest of all food," constituted the fisherman's god. Without this Mokoiro, as the divinity was called, no canoe would venture over the reef to fish. The same device was used in inviting great chiefs to a feast ; the sacred cinet, however, being omitted. The principal taro patch in each district was analogically designated the "iku kikau," as its possession indicated chieftainship. All " raui," or taboo restrictions, were and are still made by means of an entire cocoa-nut leaf plaited after a certain ancient pattern. The preceding myth is evidently designed for the glorification of the Amama, or priestly tribe, who were worshippers of Tiaio under the double form of shark and eel. In the year 1855, at the very place indicated in this story, an enormous eel, measuring seven feet in length, was caught by daylight in a strong fish-net. In heathenism this would have been regarded as a visit of Tiaio, and the dainty morsel allowed to return under the 8o Myths and Songs. rocks unmolested. As it was, it furnished several families with a good supper. In a figurative sense, Kongo's cocoa-nuts are human heads. Hence the common phrase respecting the beginning of war, " Kua va'i i te akari a Rongo " = the cocoa-nuts of Rongo have been split open; in other words, men have been clubbed. The mass of the people, chiefs included, never struck off the top of a cocoa-nut in order to drinkbut were content to suck the refreshing liquid through the hole which nature provides. The cocoa-nuts of the priests were invariably struck off (tipi take) when drunk by them, symbolical of the fact that with them lay the power of life and death. Chiefs and warriors were merely instruments of their vengeance. TAHITIAN MYTH OF THE COCOA-NUT TREE. A king named Tai (sea) had a wife named Uta (shore) who was anxious to visit her relatives. But Tai did not like her to go without a present. He therefore inquired of the oracle what would be most suitable. The god directed him to send his wife to the stream to watch for an eel; that she should cut off the head of the first that presented itself, and deposit it in a calabash and carefully plug up the aperture. The eel was then to be thrown back into the water, and the calabash carried to the husband. Upon Uta's return from the stream, the king inquired whether she had been successful. The wife joyfully said yes, and laid the well-plugged calabash at his feet. Tai now advised her to start on her intended journey, and present the precious calabash to her parents and brothers, "for there is a wondrous virtue in it" Hu Tree Myths. 81 told her that it would grow into a cocoa-nut tree, and would bear delicious fruit never before seen. He enjoined her on no account to turn aside from the path, nor to bathe in any tempting fountain, not to sit down, nor to sleep on the road, and above all not to put down the calabash. Uta gladly started on her journey. For a while all went well ; but, at length, the sun being high in the heavens, she became veryhot and weary. Perceiving a crystal stream, she forgot her promise to her husband, put down the calabash, and leapt into the inviting waters. After luxuriating for some time in this manner, she cast a glance at the calabash ; but, lo 1 it had sprouted the eel's head had become a young tree with strange leaves ! Grieved at her own folly, she ran to the bank and strove with all her might to pull it up j but could not, for its roots had struck deep. Uta wept long and bitterly. Perplexed now what to do, with joy she perceived a little messenger-bird from her husband directing her to return. She went back to the king with shame and fear, and related to him all that had befallen her. Tai sadly said to her, " Go back to the place where thou didst see the eel whose head was cut off and deposited in the calabash. Seek for the living, wriggling tail. When found, get a stick and kill it : then come back and tell me." Uta did as she was desired; but as soon as she entered their dwelling her husband expired in expiation of her sin. THE IRON-WOOD TREE. The iron-wood tree (casuarina) was originally introduced by the Tongans, and planted in a deep sequestered valley at Tamarua, named Angaruaau. In the course of years it attained to a great size, and the fame of this graceful and stately exotic spread over 82 Myths and Songs. the island. Oarangi and his four friends, hearing of its various uses in other lands, resolved to appropriate it to themselves, and thus to gain a superiority over the rest of their countrymen. In a secret conference about the matter, some advised Oarangi to have nothing to do with the tree, as it was an impersonation of an evil spirit named Vaotere. Oarangi, however, resolved that the famous tree should come down, in order to furnish him new and better weapons of war. Thief-like, they started by night on their ill-starred expedition, each provided with a sharp stone axe and a candle-nut torch. Arrived at the hill-side, they easily found the tree, so utterly unlike all others, in its long slender branches and wiry leaves, and towering above all its companions. It had four gigantic roots, gnarled and twisted in fantastic shapes. The torches were placed on the ground around the tree, making the night light as day. The four woodmen zealously set to work upon the four great roots, whilst Oarangi sat at a little distance to watch their progress. From time to time they changed all round, as some made cleaner and deeper cuts than others. But curiously enough, when each returned to the root which had nearly been severed, he found it restored to its original condition, as if no axe had ever touched it. The astonished men desisted awhile to consult with Oarangi, who, resolved to attain his object, advised that each should keep to his own root until entirely severed. Again they plied their axes, and oirrying out the advice of Oarangi, they eventually succeeded in their endeavours. At dawn the tree fell to the ground, with a tremendous crash. By full daylight the top had been lopped off, and the ponderous trunk lay on the soil. They had triumphed. They resolved now to return home to rest ; to-morrow they would come back to finish their task. Tree Myths. 83 At this moment the four men were taken ill, and began to vomit blood the redness of the blood answering to the redness of the inner bark of the iron-wood tree which had been so injured by them. They staggered to the stream which winds through the valley, and sought relief in its waters, but kept on vomiting until two of their number died, and their unburied bodies were left in the tall fern. Oarangi and the two surviving woodmen went off with heavy hearts. Upon reaching the crest of the hill overlooking the scene of their midnight toil, to their utter astonishment they saw that the great tree they had so recently felled was growing as stately as ever. They retraced their steps, in order carefully to note this wonderful phenomenon. There was no mark whatever of an axe on the resuscitated tree; even the chips all around had disappeared. The tree was restored to its former condition, with this difference, however the trunk, branches, and leaves were now all of the brightest red : as if resenting the treatment it had received, it bled at every pore, They slowly wended their way homewards, but ere long the two surviving woodmen fell dead in the road. Oarangi, greatly annoyed at his failure, resolved that his next attempt should be made by daylight, in the hope of better success. With a number of friends he returned one day to the valley in quest of this tree. Upon arriving at the summit of the hill, where the tree could first be seen, their eyes became totally blinded. With difficulty they descended to the bottom of the valley, and wearied themselves in searching for the tree. But after wandering about all day in its immediate neighbourhood, they groped their way homewards at nightfall without having found it at all. Oarangi had done his utmost, but had been foiled by the 84 Myths and Songs. malicious demon of the iron-wood tree, and soon after died. But was there no one who could overcome Vaotere, and render the wood of the tree useful to mankind? Ono came from the land whence this tree was originally derived, and had in his possession a remarkable iron-wood spade, named Rua-i-paku = the-holewhere-il-must-faU, given to him by his father Ruatea, ere he set out on his voyagings, for any dangerous emergency. This talisman was very valuable as a club. Armed with Rua-i-paku, he resolved to do battle with the demon Vaotere. Upon reaching the shady valley of Angaruaau, he carefully surveyed the coveted tree, and began his operations by digging up the earth about the roots, being careful, however, to avoid injuring any of the main ones. Day after day, entirely unassisted, the brave Ono persevered in his arduous task in pursuing the roots in all their deviations over the valley and hill-side. Upon their becoming small and unimportant, although exceedingly numerous, he fearlessly chopped them with his famous spade. The chips new in all directions, over hill and vale, under his mighty blows. After many days' toil all the surface roots were bared and severed at their extremities, so that the tree began to totter. The tap-root alone remained. Ono dug to a great depth into the red soil, and then, at a blow, divided it At this critical moment, the head and horrid visage of the evil spirit Vaotere became visible, distorted with rage at being again disturbed. His open jaws, filled with terrible teeth, prepared to make an end of the impious Ono, who, perceiving his danger, with one well-directed blow of his spade-club luckily succeeded in splitting the skull of Vaotere. The victorious Ono now. leisurely removed the four great gnarled roots which were, in sooth, the arms of the fierce Vaotere, md afterwards divided the enormous trunk the bleeding body Tree Myths. 85 of the demon into three unequal portions : one to furnish a quantity of long spears, another to be split into arad, or " skullcleavers;" the third to furnish aro, or wooden swords. All this was accomplished by the versatile qualities of Rua-i-paku, which was used first as a spade, then as a club, and now as an axe. The thousand chips from the small roots of this wonderful tree falling everywhere over hill and valley and sea-shore, originated the ironwood trees now covering the island : but, happily, Vaotere can no more injure mankind. Until a few years ago this was believed to be the true origin of all the iron-wood on the island. It is not surprising that the heavy wood which in past times furnished all the deadly implements of war, should have been regarded as the embodiment of an evil spirit The possession of land and the slaughter of men were alike the result of the use of this famous tree. "Toa" signifies indifferently " iron-wood," and what most resembles it, a "warrior." A series of songs on the exploits of Ono once existed. They are believed to have been several hundreds of years old. Such compositions are called "pee manuiri," i.e. "songs relating to visitors." They are known to be the oldest extant The following fragment relates to the preceding myth: ONO FELLS A FAMOUS TREE. TUMU. INTRODUCTION.

The style is very unlike that of later times, when the art of song-making became a national passion. There is no reference to the known history of Mangara. The "Iva " referred to is believed to be Nukuh/z/. the-ever-distant, or the~hide-and-$eek-spirit ; but forthwith heard himself cursed in exactly the same tone and words. Evidently this satirical, unseen being was no respecter of persons. Rangi fell immeasurably in his own estimation at being thus unceremoniously addressed, and felt sure that it was intended as a reflection upon his illegitimate origin. The first sovereign of Mangaia now resolved, at any cost, to get a sight of the insolent creature pertinaciously hiding in the rocks. Cautiously leaping from boulder to boulder, he entered the gorge, inquiring as he proceeded, for the hitherto invisible inhabitant ; but receiving for his pains only sarcastic replies. The chasm grew darker and narrower, but Rangi bravely kept on his way. Upon suddenly looking up, to his astonishment, he found that the semi-circular roof was everywhere covered with transparent glittering pendants (stalactites), white, like a row of formidable teeth, almost touching his person, drops of cold water meanwhile falling like rain upon the stone flooring. Underneath 1 1 6 Myths and Songs. was a row of stumps (stalagmites), rising from the basement of the the cave. Awe-stricken at the sight of these vast open jaws, apparently about to swallow him up, he instinctively retreated a few steps, and, looking up once more, for the first time caught a glimpse of the face of a female fairy, heartily laughing at his terror. As soon as Rangi recovered his equanimity, he inquired the proper name of this formidable apparition. Her reply was, "I am T^lm^tteanaoa? or Echo (literally, " the-cave-speaking-sprite "). " I am the being that everywhere inhabited the rocks of Mangaia ere you set feet on the soil." Rangi now asked whether she had any children. Echo replied, " I have a very numerous offspring, named Tuwu-te-erue ma, or Earth-diggers." " Where are they?" demanded the inquisitive king. "They are on the mountains, roaming about in the fern," replied the complaisant spirit of the cave. Rangi now left Echo, and went in search of her children. He had not advanced far up the side of the nearest mountain, trampling down the fern and tall reeds, when he came upon a troop of these " earth-diggers," or rats! Rangi wondered that the progeny were so unlike their mother, who could on no account be persuaded to leave her favourite haunts in the rocks. The cave where Rangi first made the acquaintance of Tumuteanaoa, or Echo, was thenceforth named Aitu-mamaoa, 1 or the home of the ever-distant, or hide-and-seek spirit. 1 The writer, in company with the Rev. J. Chalmers, once explored Aitu-mamaoa for half a mile, until the torches were nearly burnt out and the roof necessitated a creeping posture. About midway a running stream crossed our path. We sung a number of hymns, and were delighted to hear, at a great height above our heads in utter darkness, a most perfect echo as if an unseen choir were singing in perfect unison with our torch-lit company. Miscellaneous Myths. 117 In the course of his subsequent explorations, Rangi often met with this notable nymph Echo, who seemed to be ubiquitous, and learnt that besides the " earth-diggers " in the dry grass and fern of the mountains, she had another numerous offspring inhabiting the valleys and the dark waters of the little lake in Veitatei, viz., shrimps, eels, and other fresh-water fish abounding there and in the interior gorges and chasms of the adjacent rocks her own constant resort Rangi thus found that his little world was already teeming with inhabitants, all descended from the great Tumu-te-ana-oa. No disturbance or difficulty ever arose therefrom, as Echo was a nymph of a gentle and harmless disposition; her only fault being that she was a little satirical when addressed by strangers. It was often contested by the sages of former times, whether Rangi, after all, was rightly designated the first inhabitant of Mangaia, seeing that he found Echo already in possession of the rocks and caves. They came at last to the conclusion, that whilst Rangi was the first man and king, Echo was the first and parent fairy the numerous sprites inhabiting rocks, valleys, hills, and streams constituting the prolific progeny of "the cave speaking sprite." At the Marquesas, to this day, divine honours are paid to Echo, who is supposed to give them food, and who " speaks to the worshippers out of the rocks." n8 Myths and Songs. THE PRINCE OF REED-THROWERS. Upon one occasion Tangaroa chanced to see the lovely Inaani-vai, i.e. Inarsolidted-at-the-fountain, bathing at a stream named Kapuue-rangi, and at once became enamoured of her charms. The god unfastened his girdle, which mortals call the rainbow,, and by this dazzling pathway descended to earth. The fair but frail Ina could not resist the advances of the great Tangaroa; and in the course of time she gave birth to Tarauri and Turi-theBald. She chose to live apart from her friends, so that the divine origin of her offspring was long unsuspected. Both Tarauri and Turi were flaxen-haired. There was at the same time a man named Pinga, whose seven sons were alike noted for their shortness of stature and for their proficiency in the art of reed-throwing. 1 The clever dwarf sons of Pinga induced Turi-the-Bald to try his luck in this game. Again and again was Turi beaten by the clever sons of Pinga, so that he wept with vexation and shame. Now the elder brother had taken no part in these games. But he was distinguished for his skill in wrestling with lads of his ownage, and for catching a small fresh-water fish, called kokopu, abounding in the tiny streams which thread the valleys. The mode of angling said to have been invented by Tarauri, and still in use amongst enterprising lads, was curious. The leaves of the pandanus, or thatch, tree are furnished with somewhat formidable thorns. The serrated edges of a stout leaf are pared off; the 1 On Mangaia this popular game was practised by men, the women being spectators ; or by women, the men being spectators : never by men and women together, as in some islands. Miscellaneous Myths. 119 narrow pieces are then carefully tied together with a bit of hibiscus bark, care being taken that there be at least two thorns or tiny fish-hooks on either side, and that these little hooks point upwards. The slit midrib of a long cocoa-nut frond furnishes the fishing rod the thorny hooks being secured to the tapering end. The sport is enjoyed wherever the stream is dammed up for the purpose of irrigating the little taro-patches of the valleys, or to enable women and children the more easily to fill their empty calabashes with water. The voracious little kokopu leaps to catch the bait its favourite morsel, the shrimp when it finds itself a prisoner on one of the thorns of this quaint fish-hook. The " seven dwarf sons of Pinga " were delighted with the adroitness of Tarauri, although as yet his name and that of his brother were unknown. Pinga desired his sons to ask the lads their names, a most unpleasant task to a South Sea Islander. The boys good-naturedly told their names, but did not reveal the secret of their divine origin. As soon as Pinga heard their names, he astonished his " seven dwarf sons " by exclaiming, " Why, these are my grand-children ! Bring them here." Very willingly did the lads take up their abode with their newly-found grandfather for a while. One day " the seven dwarf sons of Pinga" made preparations for their favourite amusement of reed-throwing, purposing this time to measure their skill with Tarauri himself. They started off to the deepest recesses of the valleys, where the longest reeds grow. Tarauri, with affected modesty, declined to accompany his seven dwarf uncles, saying to them, " Your broken reeds will be good enough for a clumsy fellow like me." After a while they returned, each with a bundle of fine reeds, and sat down to get them ready. First of all it was necessary to secure with a piece of strong bark the thick end of I2O Myths and Songs. the reed, which might strike against a stone and be broken. Then the smaller end was nicely rounded, so as not to injure the finger of the player ; finally, the reeds were slightly singed over a fire, in order to render them perfectly straight. The game commenced ; but still Tarauri was without a single reed (tao). " The seven dwarf sons of Pinga," having each thrown his reed, called upon Tarauri to come forward and try his luck. They were all on the tiptoe of expectation to see what he would do in this emergency. Tarauri rose from the ground, and advancing towards the appointed place for throwing, thus invoked the aid of his father Tangaroa : Kauo lake, kauo lake, Oh, be propitious, oh, be propitious, Uo iake te marama, te marama, Grant me light and success. la Ruanuku e, Ruanuku ma Tangaroa, Great Ruanuku, associated with Tangaroa, Omai taku tao, ei teka naku, Send me a reed for this game, Ei teka ki te taua e ! That the victory may be mine ! At these last words there fell from the skies at the feet of Tarauri a noble reed, perfectly straight, and gaily adorned with red-parrot feathers, the first ever seen on the island. Thus the divine parentage of Tarauri was discovered. Confidently advancing to the place for throwing the reeds, Tarauri swung his arms jauntily in preparation, and again invoked divine aid : Apai na, apai na rava la, e Tarauri, i te tai karongata, Taki na uri e kai ai, e rere ai e, tu arangaranga, Apai na, e Tangaroa, to manga ! Bear it away, oh, "bear it far away, for Tarauri's sake, to the treacherous ocean. Guide the flight of my reed, that it may rise to a dizzy height. Great Tangaroa, here goes thine own ! At this, " the seven dwarf sons of Pinga/' dreading a disgrace to themselves, rushed to encircle Tarauri, so as to render it Miscellaneous Myths. 121 apparently impossible for him to exhibit his divinely acquired superiority in the art of reed-throwing over these well-practised but mere human players. A second time the invocation was repeated to Tangaroa, but again the jealousy of his newly-found relatives prevented him from throwing his gaily ornamented reed. A pause ensued, when Tarauri observing that the legs of one of the seven were a little open, in an instant drove the heaven-sent reed through the gap of the living enclosure. Wonderful, indeed, was the flight of the reed : it rose and rose in the air until lost in the azure skies, where it remained eight whole days! At last the slender shaft fell at Areuna, 1 the original marae of the Mautara, or priestly tribe. Thus did Tangaroa redeem the disgrace of his younger son Turi-the-Bald. And great, indeed, was the chagrin of "the seven dwarf sons of Pinga" to be thus beaten by young Tarauri, who thus at his first trial, aided by his divine parent, proved himself to be the true patron and chief of all reed-players. By some this myth is placed in " the land of Ukupolu," i.e. Upolu. The very archaic form of the invocations attests the antiquity of this story. Of the many songs for reed-matches, none would be complete without a reference to Tarauri the chief patron of the game. 1 Areuna is on the south of the island, and is regarded as the ancient home of the priests of Motoro, who swayed Mangaia as priests first, and afterwaids as chiefs down to the establishment of Christianity. The early part of this myth may serve to explain why in heathenism all illegitimate children were designated "tamariki na te Atua," i.e. children of Egg-shaped. Peru* =A winged kite Taiaro = Club-shaped, (or Bird-shaped). Miscellaneous Myths. 123 THE ORIGIN OF KITE-FLYING. Tane in the shades once challenged Rongo to a game of kiteflying. But the issue of this trial of skill was the utter discomfiture of Tane by his elder brother Rongo, who had secretly provided himself with an enormous quantity of string. From this first kite-flying mortals have acquired the agreeable pastime, the condition of each game being that the first kite that mounts the sky should be sacred to, and should bear the name of, Rongo, the great patron of the art. The names of all subsequent kites were indifferent To this contest reference is made in A KITE SONG FOR TENIO'S FETE. BY KOROA, CIRCA 1814. Call for the dance to lead 0$. Ua kapi te puku i Atiu !

Riding across the island alone one dark rainy night, I was delighted to see just ahead what seemed to be a man carrying a lighted torch. I shouted to my supposed companion to wait a little until I could get up to him. Receiving no reply, I spurred my horse ; but as the creature made its way with difficulty through the deep mire, I was not a little annoyed to see the light dancing on and on. But as it kept to the path I suspected nothing. A clump of trees now hid the windings of the road : this mocking companion seemed to dart through its gloomiest recesses in a most inexplicable manner. After a long and weary chase the light forsook the beaten track, and hovered over the deep waters of the little lake in that neighbourhood. I had been chasing an ignis fatuust Upon reaching home that night, and relating my advenMiscellaneous Myths. 125 ture, the natives jestingly remarked, "Uti has been lighting up your path with her torch." In the very depths of nether-land Is a district named Manomano, or Countless, swayed by a female fairy called Uti. Her delight is to climb up at night to this world of ours, provided with a torch, in search of food. Sometimes Uti's torch may be seen slowly moving along the reef; now on the rocky shore ; occasionally she threads the damp valleys, where prawns abound, and thence will glide up mountain ridges. But Uti's chief resort is the neighbourhood of the lake already referred to. Sometimes the fairy moves alone ; at other times attended by one or more of her daughters, each taking a different route. It was Uti who first taught the women of this upper world the pastime of catching the sleeping fish by torch-light, 1 or waylaying crabs ashore, or shrimping in her favourite lake on the south of the island. Hence the old song: Tungia te ai, e Uti, Light thy torch, O Uti, Ei turama ia Manomano. That illuminates spirit-world (literally, Manomano).

Here it merely expresses the great depth from which the fairy clambers up. 126 Myths and Songs. The first night of the native calendar was sacred to Iro (in Tahitian, Hiro ; in New Zealand, Whiro), the patron of thieves, as being his natal night ; or, as sceptical moderns think, a moonless night is naturally favourable to a thieving expedition. It is hoped that the great divinities, i.e. " the children of Vatea," will not allow Iro's tricks to pass with impunity. Uti is invoked to come to the aid of the sufferers, by lighting her torch over the taro patches to be robbed : for the boldest thief would be terrified by the sight, and would precipitately retire. Vaangaru, lamenting (circa 1815) for his dead mother-in-law, Anau, sings : Taumata ra i te tai : She glances at the sea Kua eke i Kopuaterea. And plies her torch-fishing. Tunu mai i te ai ramarama.

These most annoying insects are said to have been unknown in Mangaia, until a woman named Veve landed with her children from AitutakL In those days ear-ornaments of a prodigious size were worn by men and women. To admit these clumsy adornments, the ears were slit in childhood and enlarged by constant pressure, until at last a small cocoa-nut 1 (vao) could be inserted Fragrant leaves and even flowers were put inside, and the opening carefully plugged up. Now Veve, on leaving her native island, filled up the hollow of 1 This is a literal truth. Miscellaneous Myths. 127 her enormous ear-ornaments with mosquitoes, so as to have the pleasure of hearing their continual hum / But shortly after landing on the eastern part of the island, she went to a pleasant retired little stream, to enjoy the luxury of a bath, and left her singular ear-ornaments on the grassy bank. That same night she went torch-fishing on the reef, and there recollected her missing ear-plugs. Upon returning home, she found two of her children stung to death by the mosquitoes, which had by their loud humming contrived to burst their prison-house ! Her other two children had escaped with their lives by entirely immersing their bodies in the neighbouring stream, their mouth and nostrils only being above water. Veve set fire to her dwelling, hoping to exterminate the noxious insects she had thoughtlessly introduced to her future home. The majority, indeed, perished; but a few escaped to the neighbouring rocks. From that remnant the present disagreeable race of mosquitoes are descended. To this old belief Tenio refers in his f&te song : Kua topa te poe i te taringa : Thy ear-ornaments were lost; Kua vare paa i Vaikaute. When bathing at Vaikaute. Na tangi namu i vavai. The loud humming burst them open. Kua kai te namu ka pou raua. Alas ! they stung both children to death. It is the custom of the natives to keep burning outside each house a log of dry iron-wood, which if left alone will, like touchwood, smoulder on until the whole is consumed. Of course the smoke readily penetrates the reed sides of a native hut, and drives away the mosquitoes. But as the smoke does not invariably suffice to expel these irritating foes, it is the custom to sleep with the head and face well wrapped up. In the hot, damp season, if a native cannot sleep on account 128 Myths and Songs. of mosquitoes, he lights a torch and waits until all his pertinacious little foes axe delightedly buzzing round it He then slowly carries the light outside, of course conducting the insect-army with it Suddenly quenching the torch, he now rushes back inside the house and closes the sliding door. " THE-LONG-LIVED." The formation of Mangaia is remarkably hilly. In the middle^ of the island is a hill, half a mile long and 250 feet wide, named Rangimotia, or Centre-of-the-heavens, from which the lesser hills branch out on every side. This central hill was considered very sacred in the olden time, for there the kings of past generations adjusted the sacred girdle on warriors bound on secret murdering expeditions in the name of Rongo. The condition of wearing this girdle was, " succeed or die." About a century ago a rash chief, named Uarau, resolved to celebrate his accession to supreme temporal power by holding a grand feast on this sacred spot The leading men of the day were sure that such an act of daring impiety would draw down the anger of the gods, and therefore deprived Uarau of his chieftainship. The reason alleged for the sacredness of the hill is this : A god, Te-manaya-roa, 1 or The-long-lived, lies buried, face downwards, at Rangimotia, His proportions are wonderful: the length of the level hill half a mile being the measurement of his back ! His head is at Butoa, towards the sun-rising. The marked depression between, is the neck of The-long-lived. His right arm is the line of hills stretching away to the S.E., a distance of two miles, and touching the mission premises at Tamarua. His 1 One of the three primary stationary spirits bears this name, but must be distinguished from this buried giant. Miscellaneot&s Myths. 129 left arm is represented by a hill-range, of equal length, pn the opposite side of the island. The right leg of The-long-lived is the line of somewhat irregular hills extending about three miles on the S.W. of the island. The left leg is a chain of equal length on the N.W. These " arms " and " legs " serve one important purpose to mark off the different districts into which the island is naturally divided It is in allusion to this myth that the southern half of Mangaia is invariably called " the right side," and the northern half " the left side." The eastern part of Mangaia is always termed the "pauru" Oft head. Whenever, in the olden time, a large stranded fish was obtained, this fancy guided the cutting up and presentation of the different parts of the fish. The head, as a matter-of-course, went to the two chiefs at " the sun-rising," where the head of TJie-longlived was supposed to lie. The central part of the fish would go to the two chiefs of the central portion of Mangaia the fish being divided along the back-bone, in order that the shares might be equal. The tail was divided between the two remaining chiefs, whose homes are at "the sun-setting." The larger portions were subdivided, until each individual had a minute share. But these subdivisions were not made until the name of the chief of the entire district had first been proclaimed. To this day, in all great feasts, the etiquette is, after calling out the name of the king, to announce in a prescribed order the names of the six chiefs of Mangaia, beginning with one of the chiefs on the east, and then going round in regular order until the 130 Myths and Songs. second chief on the east had been called out, and the circuit of the island completed. This is done now partly as a matter of custom, and partly as a matter of real convenience jealousy being thus prevented. Few of the younger people understand the ancient reason for the practice.
