[29:5] Anyone hoping to meet GOD, (should know that) such a meeting with GOD will most assuredly come to pass. He is the Hearer, the Omniscient. [24:39] As for those who disbelieve, their works are like a mirage in the desert. A thirsty person thinks that it is water. But when he reaches it, he finds that it is nothing, and he finds GOD there instead, to requite him fully for his works. GOD is the most efficient reckoner.

At the end of our Journey on earth, we earn only one pass to an eternal abode - eternal bliss or eternal suffering. At the end of the path, we will face God and all of us will receive the records of everything we did, said, or thought of. All souls will be treated accordingly and as promised without the least injustice.

Being a warner as well as a bearer of good news, Quran cites the best examples and uses many attributes to delicately describe for us the awesome day of resurrection so we do not claim we had no idea what would take place on that day. Taking heed and reflecting is practiced only by the minority. The following is an attempt to list some of the attributes and descriptions of the Day of Judgment. While sometimes some attributes are translated the same, this day is described with a wide range of distinct and beautiful descriptions in the Arabic text:

- The Day of Eternity, "Yawm Al-Khulood":

[50:34] Enter it in peace; this is the Day of Eternity.

- The Day of Religion, "Yawm Al-Deen", translated as the Day of Judgment. The "Day of Religion" implies the ultimate victory of God's one religion to humanity on that day:

[1:4] Master of the Day of Judgment (Day of Religion).

[74:46] "We disbelieved in the Day of Judgment (Day of Religion).

[82:18] What a day; the Day of Judgment (Day of Religion)!

Other verses that has "Yawm Al- Deen" or Day of Religion are 15:35, 26:82, 37:20, 38:78, 51:12, 56:56, 70:26, 82:15,17, 83:11

- The Promised Day, "Yawm Al-Waeed":

[50:20] The horn is blown; this is the promised day.

- The Hour, "Alsaa" :

[43:66] Are they waiting for the Hour (Day of Judgment) to come to them suddenly when they least expect it?

[54:46] The Hour is awaiting them, and the Hour is far worse and more painful.

- The Appointed Day ,"Yawm Al-Waqt Al-Maaloom" :

[38:81] "Until the appointed day."

- The Day of Resurrection, "Yowm Al-Qeyamah" also described by God as "Yawm Al-Baath" in 30:56. Both mean the day we all rise up again before God (39:68):

[19:95] All of them will come before Him on the Day of Resurrection (Yowm Al-Qeyamah) as individuals.

[30:56] Those who are blessed with knowledge and faith will say, "You have lasted, according to GOD's decree, until the Day of Resurrection (Yawm Al-Baath). Now, this is the Day of Resurrection, but you failed to recognize it."

- The Day of Decision, " Yam Al-Furqan". Also described by God as "Yawm Al- Fasl" in 37:21. Both mean the day detailed, precise, and just rulings will take place:

[8:41] You should know that if you gain any spoils in war, one-fifth shall go to GOD and the messenger, to be given to the relatives, the orphans, the poor, and the traveling alien. You will do this if you believe in GOD and in what we revealed to our servant on the day of decision (Yam Al-Furqan), the day the two armies clashed. GOD is Omnipotent.

[37:21] This is the day of decision (Yawm Al- Fasl) that you used to disbelieve in.

- The Day of Remorse, "Yawm Al-Hasrah":

[19:39] Warn them about the day of remorse, when judgment will be issued. They are totally oblivious; they do not believe.

- The Day of Mutual Blaming, "Yawm Al-Taghabun":

[64:9] The day will come when He summons you to the Day of Summoning. That is the Day of Mutual Blaming. Anyone who believes in GOD and leads a righteous life, He will remit his sins, and will admit him into gardens with flowing streams. They abide therein forever. This is the greatest triumph.

- The Day of Reckoning, "Yawm Al-Hisab":

[38:16] They challenged: "Our Lord, why do you not rush the retribution for us, before the Day of Reckoning."

[38:53] This is what you have deserved on the Day of Reckoning.

- The Day of Summoning, "Yawm Al-Gama" which means the day we rise up all together before God. Also is described by God as "Yawm Al-Talaqi" in 40:15 which means the day we all meet with God, and in 40:32 as "Yawm Al-Tanadi", which means the day we all get called upon:

[42:7] We thus reveal to you an Arabic Quran to warn the central community and all around it, and to warn about the Day of Summoning (Yawm Al-Gama) that is inevitable. Some will end up in Heaven, and some in Hell.

[40:15] Possessor of the highest ranks, and Ruler of the whole dominion. He sends inspiration, bearing His commands, to whomever He chooses from among His servants, to warn about the Day of Summoning (Yawm Al-Talaqi).

[40:32] "O my people, I fear for you the Day of Summoning (Yawm Al-Tanadi).

- The Inevitable, "Al waqiaa":

[56:1] When the inevitable comes to pass.

[79:34] Then, when the great blow comes.

[78:2] The great event. [78:3] That is disputed by them.

- The Shocker, " Al-Qareaah":

[101:1] The Shocker.
[101:2] What a shocker!

- The Overwhelming, "Al-Ghasheiah":

[88:1] Are you aware of the Overwhelming?
[88:2] Faces on that day will be shamed.....
[88:8] Other faces on that day will be full of joy.

- On that day....

[42:47] You shall respond to your Lord before a day comes which is decreed inevitable by GOD. There will be no refuge for you on that day, nor an advocate.

[21:104] On that day, we will fold the heaven, like the folding of a book. Just as we initiated the first creation, we will repeat it. This is our promise; we will certainly carry it out.

[39:68] The horn will be blown, whereupon everyone in the heavens and the earth will be struck unconscious, except those who will be spared by GOD. Then it will be blown another time, whereupon they will all rise up, looking.
[39:69] Then the earth will shine with the light of its Lord. The record will be proclaimed, and the prophets and the witnesses will be brought forth. Everyone will then be judged equitably, without the least injustice.

[50:21] Every soul comes with a herder and a witness.
[50:22] You used to be oblivious to this. We now remove your veil; today, your vision is (as strong as) steel.

[7:8] The scales will be set on that day, equitably. Those whose weights are heavy will be the winners.

[40:17] On that day, every soul will be requited for whatever it had earned. There will be no injustice on that day. GOD is most efficient in reckoning.

[75:13] The human being will be informed, on that day, of everything he did to advance himself, and everything he did to regress himself.

[20:108] On that day, everyone will follow the caller, without the slightest deviation. All sounds will be hushed before the Most Gracious; you will hear nothing but whispers.

[20:102] That is the day when the horn is blown, and we summon the guilty on that day blue.

[36:65] On that day we will seal their mouths; their hands and feet will bear witness to everything they had done.

[23:101] When the horn is blown, no relations among them will exist on that day, nor will they care about one another.

[22:2] The day you witness it, even a nursing mother will discard her infant, and a pregnant woman will abort her fetus. You will see the people staggering, as if they are intoxicated, even though they are not intoxicated. This is because GOD's retribution is so awesome.

[31:33] O people, you shall reverence your Lord, and fear a day when a father cannot help his own child, nor can a child help his father. Certainly, GOD's promise is truth. Therefore, do not be distracted by this life; do not be distracted from GOD by mere illusions.

[43:67] The close friends on that day will become enemies of one another, except for the righteous.

[34:42] On that day, you possess no power to help or harm one another, and we will say to the transgressors, "Taste the retribution of the Hell that you used to deny."

[82:19] That is the day when no soul can help another soul, and all decisions, on that day, will belong to GOD.

[4:42] On that day, those who disbelieved and disobeyed the messenger will wish that they were level with the ground; not a single utterance will they be able to hide from GOD.

[89:23] On that day, Gehenna will be brought forth. On that day, the human being will remember - but what a remembrance - it will be too late.

[18:100] We will present Hell, on that day, to the disbelievers.

[14:49] And you will see the guilty on that day chained in shackles.

[25:13] And when they are thrown into it, through a narrow place, all shackled, they will declare their remorse.
[25:14] You will not declare just a single remorse, on that day; you will suffer through a great number of remorses.

[30:57] Therefore, no apology, on that day, will benefit the transgressors, nor will they be excused.

[75:10] The human being will say on that day, "Where is the escape?"

[20:109] On that day, intercession will be useless, except for those permitted by the Most Gracious, and whose utterances conform to His will.

[55:39] On that day, no human, nor a jinn, will be asked about his sins.

[57:13] On that day, the hypocrite men and women will say to those who believed, "Please allow us to absorb some of your light." It will be said, "Go back behind you, and seek light." A barrier will be set up between them, whose gate separates mercy on the inner side, from retribution on the outer side.

[52:46] On that day, their schemes will not protect them, nor will they be helped.

[40:16] That is the day when everyone will be completely exposed; none of them will hide anything from GOD. To whom belongs all sovereignty on that day? To GOD, the One, the Supreme.

[25:26] All sovereignty on that day belongs to the Most Gracious. For the disbelievers, it will be a difficult day.

[102:8] Then you will be questioned, on that day, about the blessings you had enjoyed.

[57:12] The day will come when you see the believing men and women with their lights radiating ahead of them and to their right. Good news is yours that, on that day, you will have gardens with flowing streams. You will abide therein forever. This is the great triumph.

[22:56] All sovereignty on that day belongs to GOD, and He will judge among them. As for those who believe and lead a righteous life, they have deserved the gardens of bliss.

[25:24] The dwellers of Paradise are far better on that day; they will hear better news.

[36:55] The dwellers of Paradise will be, on that day, happily busy.

[43:68] O My servants, you will have no fear on that day, nor will you grieve.

[80:38] Some faces on that day will be happy.

[88:8] Other faces on that day will be full of joy.

[28:65] On that day, He will ask everyone, "How did you respond to the messengers?"
[28:66] They will be so stunned by the facts on that day, they will be speechless.
[28:67] As for those who repent, believe, and lead a righteous life, they will end up with the winners.

[37:26] They will be, on that day, totally submitting.
[37:27] They will come to each other, questioning and blaming one another.
[37:28] They will say (to their leaders), "You used to come to us from the right side."
[37:29] They will respond, "It is you who were not believers.
[37:30] "We never had any power over you; it is you who were wicked.
[37:31] "We justly incurred our Lord's judgment; now we have to suffer.
[37:32] "We misled you, only because we were astray."
[37:33] Thus, together they will all partake of the retribution on that day.

[16:85] Once those who transgressed see the retribution, it will be too late; it will not be commuted for them, nor will they be respited.
[16:86] And when those who committed idol worship see their idols, they will say, "Our Lord, these are the idols we had set up beside You." The idols will then confront them and say, "You are liars."
[16:87] They will totally submit to GOD on that day, and the idols they had invented will disown them.

[25:27] The day will come when the transgressor will bite his hands (in anguish) and say, "Alas, I wish I had followed the path with the messenger.
[25:28] "Alas, woe to me, I wish I did not take that person as a friend.
[25:29] "He has led me away from the message after it came to me. Indeed, the devil lets down his human victims."
[25:30] The messenger said, "My Lord, my people have deserted this Quran."

[14:22] And the devil will say, after the judgment had been issued, "GOD has promised you the truthful promise, and I promised you, but I broke my promise. I had no power over you; I simply invited you, and you accepted my invitation. Therefore, do not blame me, and blame only yourselves. My complaining cannot help you, nor can your complaining help me. I have disbelieved in your idolizing me. The transgressors have incurred a painful retribution."

[6:130] O you jinns and humans, did you not receive messengers from among you, who narrated to you My revelations, and warned you about the meeting of this day? They will say, "We bear witness against ourselves." They were totally preoccupied with the worldly life, and they will bear witness against themselves that they were disbelievers.

[80:37] Each one of them, on that day, worries about his own destiny.

[75:12] To your Lord, on that day, is the final destiny.

[24:25] On that day, GOD will requite them fully for their works, and they will find out that GOD is the Truth.

Peaceful Friday, salaam, and God bless.
