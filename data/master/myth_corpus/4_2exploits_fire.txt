DRAMATIC SONG OF MIRU, MISTRESS OF SPIRITWORLD. FOR TEREAVAl'S FETE. COMPOSED BY KAPUA, 1824. Chorus. Na Miru te umu i Avaiki, Miru has an oven 2 in spint-land, Ei rangi tae ia Tane e ! Like that which devoured (the tribe of) Tane. 8 Solo. Ae ! Aye ! 1 At Mangaia " Tukaitaua " was of a malevolent disposition, the first violent death being due to his prowess. Tukaitaua taught the world the art of war. 2 The oven in daily use in each household, and particularly the monster ovens in which it was the office of the tribe of Tane to cook ti roots (dracoevm terminalis), were said to have been derived from Mini's original oven in Hades. 8 The reference is to the tribe of Tane, twice treacherously destroyed by their foes in the fires of their own ovens. 1 7 6 Myths and Songs. Ei rangi tae la Tautiti, E kai karii na Rongo e ! O Tane mata reiiua ! Nai mata reirua e, Na Miiu oki te umu ka roa I raro e ! E nunumi atu e I te aerenga ae !

Those pleasures all came to an end ; For Mini's dread oven for ever burns In the shades ! She devours all who go down. Chorus. She devours All who appioach the blazing oven "Where Mini's food is to be cooked. Whence came Mini ? From Avaiki (spirit-land), out of homd darkness.

An ancient farewell in prospect of dissolution was, " Ei ko na ra, tau taeake, ka aere an i te tava ia Miru? Le. "Farewell, brother, I go to the domains of Mini I" How inexpressibly affecting ! " Having no hope, and without God in the world." The mistress of the invisible world, so cruel to visitors, was very tenderly attached to her only son Tautiti. She would permit no one to carry his drinking water but herself. On dark nights, or 1 Mini is charged by the chorus to prepare the intoxicating cup in order to stupefy her intended victims. She is represented as building up a vast oven of ti roots of all kinds for a feast ; but Mini's ti roots are human souls ! (The song is not quite complete. ) Hades ; or, The Doctrine of Spirit-World. 177 when deep sleep had locked up the senses of mortals, Mini would make her way to the well-known fairy streams Auparu and Vaikaute, carrying the empty calabashes to be filled. To this there is an allusion in Tereavai's Fte Song : E taa vai no TautitL A calabash of water for Tautiti. Na Mini rai e kave, Mini herself will provide it, Kia inu Tane i te vai kea ra e ! So that Tane may drink this living water. Her " peerless " daughters were often seen and admired ; but the mother was most solicitous to conceal her ugly form. SNEEZING. The philosophy of sneezing is, that the spirit having gone travelling about perchance on a visit to the homes or buryingplaces of its ancestors its return to the body is naturally attended with some difficulty and excitement, occasioning a tingling and enlivening sensation all over the body. Hence the various customary remarks addressed to the returned spirit in different islands. At Rarotonga, when a person sneezes, the bystanders exclaim, as though addressing a spirit, " A, kua oki mai koe " = " Ha ! you have come back." At Manihiki and Rakaanga (colonised from Rarotonga) they say to the spirit, "Aere koe ki Rarotonga " = " Go to Rarotonga." At Mangaia the customary address is, " Ua nanave koe " = " Thou art delighted." The following well-known lines refer to Popo, or Speck-land. (For Umuakaui, circa 1823.) Puputa motu tana e ! Alas, we part for ever ! Ka acre au tei Prtpot J I go alone to Speckland. E enuaakarere Mangaia etaea mai ai ! My home, Mangaia, for ever fades from sight. N 178 Myths and Songs. Here is a reference to Tiairi^ by Koroa, in his " Lament for Tae," who was slain circa 1815. Vaerua aere i tai Spirits wandering towards the sea ; I Rangikapua te nuku o te Atua At Rangfkapua is assembled a divine hostla tu rofroe. A feeble, tottering throng ! Takina koe iia ? Whither goest thou, friend ? I Puara-moamoa i aka i Tiairi, From the leaping-place I go to dance at Tiairi t I pare i te kiato. Clothed in fragrant flowers. Another reference to Tiairi occurs in a lament for the sons of Ron, 1790 (circa). Na tokotoru a Ron Three brave sons of Ron Ei tupeke pare kura e I Wearing noble head-dresses ! Tera roa te anau te aka mai i te Yonder are they dancing the warngaere dance I te kapa toa i Tiairi. Of brave spirits in Tiairi. When Ikoke heard of the murder of his beloved younger brother Takurua, he feelingly said, "We will meet in the warriors' resting-place," 1 i.e. "I, too, will die a violent death, so that we may meet in the warriors' heaven." Not long after, this wish was granted ; for he fell in the battle of Tuopapa by those who had slain his brother, Ikoke could, according to his faith, only meet his favourite brother by a violent death, as all who die a natural death are devoured by Mini. Another saying of theirs in reference to the unseen world is : " Ka aere i nunga i te puokia ei aka i Tiairi :" " We will go to yon place of safety, Tiairi, to dance the warriors' dance." ' I nunga i te puokia maua e araveitu ei." Hades ; or, The Doctrine of SpiritWorld. 1 79 Subjoined is a mention of the famous bua tree from the shades (Arakauvae's funeral games for his father, circa 1817). E metua tane ra e, Vara, kua topa ra My father Vara, thou art forsaken by i te io, thy god. Kua veevee te po, ka eke atu ai e ! Night is at hand, whither thou must descend. E rua metua i raro e !

Wrenched off, and now in Avaiki That distant land to which thou art fled. The author of this "farewell" became a devoted servant of the Lord Jesus Christ. These words are exceedingly popular with the natives. Part is omitted Rakoia, chanting (in 1815) the praises of his first-born, Enuataurere, who was accidentally drowned at Tamarua, says : Enuataurere i te tai kura i te Enuatamere now trips o'er the ruddy moana. ocean. Te nunga koe i te uru o te kare i tai e ! Thy path is the foaming crest of the billow. Aue e ! Enuataurere e ! Weep for Enuataurere, Enuataurere e ! For Enuataurere. CHAPTER IX. OR, THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL. THE first who ever died a natural death in Mangaia was Ve&ini. He was the only and much beloved son of Tueva and his wife Manga. But Vetini, .when in the prime of early manhood, sickened and died. The parents, in their grief, instituted those signs of mourning and funeral games which were ever afterwards observed amongst these islanders. The chief mourners were Tueva, Manga, and the lovely Tiki the attached sister of Ve6tini. All these, with the more distant relatives, blackened their faces, cut off their hair, slashed their bodies with shark's teeth, and wore only " pakoko," or native cloth, dyed red in the sap of the candle-nut tree, and then dipped in the black mud of a taro-patch. The very offensive smell of this mourning garment is symbolical of the putrescent state of the dead Their heads were encircled with common fern, singed with fire to give it a red 1 The allegorical character of this interesting myth is evident from the names. Vetini means all-separating ; Tueva, mourner ; Manga, food, in allusion to the custom of offering food to the dead. Tiki signifies fetched: if a person dies, his spirit is said to be *' fetched." 1 82 Myths and Songs. appearance. 1 It was on account of Vetini that the eva, or dirge, in its four varieties, and the mourning dance, were invented and performed by the sorrowing relatives day by day. These melancholy ceremonies occupied from ten to fifteen days, according to the rank and age of the party deceased. During the entire period of mourning no beating of bark for native cloth was permitted in the district where the death occurred. A woman wishing to beat out her bark must go to another part of the island. The object in view was to avoid giving offence to the female demon Mueu, who introduced clothbeating to this world ; but who herself beats out cloth of a very different texture. Her cloth-flail is the stroke of death. So long as the mourning and funeral games were going on, Mueu was supposed to be present; when all was over she returned to her home in Avaiki, or the shades. Hence the proverb when a person dies, "Era, kua tangi te tutunga a Mueu," z. "Ah ! Mueu's flail is once more at work ! " The last resting-place of Vetini is at Rangikapua, a green spot about half a mile from the sea. The rays of the setting sun fall upon the hill, about 100 feet above the level of the ocean, thus distinguished. On the evening he was buried the dirges and dances that had been invented in his honour were performed. The parents and the sister looked wistfully towards the north, hoping for his return to their midst but in vain ! The day following they walked in sad procession, slowly chanting dirges expressive of passionate desire again to embrace the departed, along the western shore of the island. At night, 1 Since the establishment of Christianity this extravagant mode of mourning for the dead, with the single exception of the bad-smelling "pakoko," has been discontinued. Ve&tini ; or, The Immortality of the SouL 183 exhausted with grief and weariness, they slept in one of the rugged caves near the sea, having in vain strained their eyes over the ocean path where the spirit of Vetini had so lately disappeared. The mourning band next sought the lost one on the soutJiern and almost inaccessible shore of Mangaia; still there was no response to the loud cries and entreaties of the disconsolate parents and the lovely Tiki. At last they arrived at the eastern coast, and gazed over the vast expanse swept by the life-giving trade-winds. Once more the lamentations and funeral dances were duly performed At night they occupied the Ruddy Cave (Ana-kura). The entrance to this spacious cave is washed by the sur Ere dawn Tueva rose from his stony couch to watch the rising of the sun. The shadows of night were fast passing away. In a few minutes more the sun rose in all its wonted glory. Tueva now noticed a tiny dark speck beneath on the ocean, which, as the sun advanced on its course, grew larger and drew nearer, passing over the ocean in the bright trail of the sun. On arriving nearer still, this wonderful object, lightly skimming over the crest of the waves, proved to be no other than their own lost Veetini ! The now rejoicing parents rushed forwards to kiss their son, who was indeed Veetini, yet not altogether like his former self. He said to the joyful throng that he had been permitted to revisit this upper world in consequence of the passionate lamentations of his parents, and to comfort their sorrowing hearts. He also came to show mortals how to make offerings of food to please the dead. For himself, he had come and must depart in the bright track of the sun, being now a denizen of spirit-land. However, to gratify his parents and friends, Veetini asked great Tangaroa to detain 184 Myths and Songs. the sun for a short time in its course, in order that he might rest and converse awhile with his relatives. The prayer was granted, and the sun was detained while Vetini and his friends pleasantly rested in a sort of extempore house, or booth, erected for him on the spot known as Karanga-iti. At length Vetini rose, and led the half-glad and half-sorrowful procession along the beach towards the west, the sun now moving on as usual in the heavens. At last they reached Vairorongo, or Kongo's sacred stream, directly facing the setting sun. Here they rested a few minutes only, as day was fast fading away. Not far distant on the hill lay the body of Veetini. As the sun disappeared beneath the horizon, and the ocean was covered with its golden light, Veetini said he must go. The weeping parents begged him to stay with them. The son replied, " I cannot ; I do not belong to this world now ; " and then shouted impatiently : Takai la te ra Thrust down the sun, Ei eke i Tekurutukia. That I may descend to nether-land ! The parents now endeavoured to detain him by force; but, lo ! they grasped at a shadow. They watched him gliding swiftly over the western ocean in the ruddy track of the sun, and, with its last rays, Veetini, now a tiny distant speck in the train of the king of day, for ever disappeared.

Vefoini ; or, The Immortality of the So^iL 187 breaking up of a funeral party it is commonly said, " Ka ruru i te tere ia Tiki ka aere ei," i.e. " The weary travels of Tiki are over : we part." A principal reason why Veetini's spirit was permitted to revisit this world, was to institute the practice of propitiating the goodwill of the dead by offerings of food. This is alluded to in a ancient song about Vetini, by ELirikovi, circa 1760. VEETINI MEETING HIS FATHER. Tueva aka-itu i te eva i te metua, Tueva, who seven times lamented for his boy, Ae ; eaa toou ara i te ao nei ? Asked, " Why didst thou return to this world?" I ana mai au i te kave " I came," (said Ve&ini,) "to instruct you I te pakuranga ma te meringa, In making food-offerings to the dead, Meringa mai Avaiki e, Offerings to those in spiritworld ; Meringa mai io tatou metua Gifts from their relatives, E noo i te ao nei. Ei aa ? Who yet linger in this upper world. n Such was the belief and practice of heathenism. As soon as the corpse was committed to its last resting-place, the mourners selected five old cocoa-nuts, which were successively opened, and the water poured out upon the ground These nuts were then wrapped up in leaves and native cloth, and thrown towards the grave ; or, if the corpse were let down with cords into the deep chasm of " Auraka," the nuts and other food would be successively thrown down upon it. Calling loudly each time the name of the departed, they said, "Here is thy food; eat it" When the fifth nut and the accompanying "raroi," or pudding, were thrown down, the mourners said, " Farewell ! we come back no more to thee i " 1 88 Myths and Songs. Seventeen years ago, Arikikaka, the last heathen of Mangaia, lost his only son a consistent church member. The old man was inconsolable at his loss. How could it be otherwise with a heathen parent? The corpse was buried with his mother's deceased relatives, on the west of the island. The friends had dispersed to their respective homes. A day or two after, Arikikaka and his wife walked with difficulty across the island, arriving at dusk at the grave of their beloved son, with a basket of cooked food and some unopened cocoa-nuts. With many tears and affectionate words they called upon their boy to eat the food and drink the nuts (carefully opened for the convenience of the ghost at the grave, and the contents poured out upon the earth), which they had carried six miles. The aged couple slept under a tree* close to the last resting-place of their son ; and at dawn on the following morning departed. How sad that, whilst their son died in the faith and hope of the Gospel, the parents should cling to the effete superstitions of a bygone age ! It is, however, pleasing to add that in May, 1865, Arikikaka and his wife were baptized. In this case "at eventime there was light" A few years previous to the discovery of the island by Captain Cook in 1777, Ngara, priest of Motoro, was paramount chief of Mangaia. His nephew Vera died, it was believed, in consequence of having incurred the anger of that divinity by setting fire to a forest of thatch trees growing on the eastern part of the island. Not that the pandanus trees were sacred, but the oronga (urtica, argentea), growing between them, was considered to be "the hair of Motoro." Very imposing funeral rites were performed for this lad, on account of his relationship to Ngara. As in the case of Veetini, the relatives are said to have paraded the island in the vain Ve&tini ; or, The Immortality of the Soul. 189 hope of Vera's return. The body was conveyed to Tamarua and thrown down Raupa, a fearful chasm, 150 feet deep, and having communication with the sea. The entrance to this gloomy place is in the Mission premises at that village. The sorrowful parents slept in a cave hard by, in the hope that Vera would return for a day, in answer to their passionate laments. Next day the disappointed parents, followed by a long procession of mourners, returned to their dwellings. DIRGE FOR VERA : A DEATH-TALK. COMPOSED BY UANUKU. A " TIAU," OR PARTIAL WEEPING.

At the conclusion of each stanza, in the native, the name "Manga," z.e. the mother of Vetini, occurs, instead of the name of Vera's own mother. To prevent confusion of ideas, I have throughout rendered it "mother." To this day it is said of the dying at Rarotonga^ " So-and-so is passing over the sea."

" Auneke " is a point on the shore about midway between the rising and setting sun. The poet evidently places Vavau, Tonga, and Tahiti in the invisible world! Very beautifully is the father, Mitimiti, represented as chasing the spirit of his beloved Vera in this mournful journey of ghosts round half the island The ghosts stop occasionally to refresh themselves, their feet lacerated with the sharp stones over which the living can pass only when sandalled. They weep continually at the thought of leaving earth for ever. Many days are occupied in this sad journey. Mitimiti, taking advantage of these delays, hurries forward, and almost clutches the ever visible but airy form of his boy, which somehow eludes the detaining hand of the sorrowing parent PUVAI LEADING A BAND OF GHOSTS TO THE SHADES.

It was then regarded as the incarnation of the god "Mod" who delights to secrete men and things. "Momod" is strictly " the Mo6-bird." This bird is caught with extreme difficulty, being very expert in hiding itself in rat holes, tufts of grass, etc. Its eyes are fiery red. When the Pakoko tribe went on a murdering expedition, this blackbird was supposed, if propitious, to lead the way by a ball of fire lighting up the path of warriors. These pretty birds were regarded as suitable food for the dead, i.e, for dwellers in the " po ** = darkness, on account of their blackness. Hence the appropriateness of crabs and black beetles as diet for the ghosts ; besides, crabs, beetles, and worms bore into the soil, or crawl about in caves where the dead lie. 206 Myths and Songs.

Ghosts from this cave, when the coral tree blossomed, took their departure by leaping from a rock in the Mission premises to a smaller one on the inner part of the reef; thence to the outer edge of the reef; and then tripping over the ocean, like Vetini, disappeared with the sun in nether-world. Although these disembodied spirits avoid the fragrant but fatal bua tree, they cannot escape Miru, mistress of the shades.

Shallow was the grave where we buried him, There we dug his grave ; There the red soil was thrown up. How bitter the widow's grief! SECOND OFFSHOOT. Look once more at thy wife At thy beloved Turuare ; 1 1 The night Mourua (Kavoro) was slain, Turuare, the most beloved of his three wives, and her little son Taingarue, were with him in the fishing hut on the beach which they temporarily occupied. The father feared lest his little boy should be struck, but he escaped unhurt. Not so the mother of Taingarue, who bravely stripped off her own clothing in order to break the force of the blows aimed at her husband. For a time she was successful ; but, despite the efforts of this heroic woman, Mourua fell, the wife's arm being broken in the fray. Upon the retirement of the exultant party of Potai, the elder son of Mourua came to Turuare's help. The body of the slain warrior was laboriously carried by a very circuitous route, so as to escape observation, to a gorge called Imogo, half a mile from the scene of murder. In performing this last office of love, the son had at first only the aid of Turuare, who was herself suffering from the anguish of a broken arm ; but afterwards friends arrived from the interior. A grave was speedily dug with their ironwood spades, and the body of Mourua, wrapped in several folds of native cloth, was laid in the grave. Instead of filling it with earth, it was merely covered with a large stone, so as to elude the notice of his foes. It happened that the women of that part of the island, when employed in collecting candle-nuts, availed themselves of this large stone for shelling them. 212 Myths and Songs.

We who lived so happily together, now part, The cruel spear slew thee, to the horror of thy son. Thou wast attacked by stealth in the night, (Entreating thy wife), "Escape, leave me, for I am struck, I am doomed to die ! " Thus perished beloved Kavoro by the sea. His bleeding corpse lay on the sandy beach. Who shall bear it ? Wife and son will carry it away, And hide it where foes shall find it never ! Bear him, aye, bear him far away 5 So that if carefully sought by his foes, His body shall ne'er be found. The family felt so sure that Mourua must be dreadfully annoyed by the incessant noises over his head, that they disinterred the body ; which, although in an advanced state of decay, was re-anointed with fragrant oil and re-invested with fine white cloth. In a few days it was borne across the island to Tamarua, and finally thrown down the deep and gloomy chasm Raupa. A night or two after, one of the sons had a dream, in which Mourua reproached his relatives for the bad treatment he had received at their hands, for no sooner had his body reached the bottom of Raupa, where so many of his own victims had been so unceremoniously hurled at different times, than the slain rose up, and most vigorously pummelled his bones until they became intolerably sore ! However, it was too late to remove him again. The motive for letting the corpse down Raupa was to prevent its falling into the hands of his numerous Ivring enemies.

Their son "Patiatoa," or " Tiki," is adjured to take under his protection his young relative Taingarue. Patiatoa ( = pierced-with-a-spear) died of measles in 1854, at an advanced age. Not long before his death, he was admitted to the Church upon a profession of his attachment to Christ. I well recollect his bent and venerable figure the day he came to be a candidate. He wa& a priest, and a special depository of all the lore of idol-worship. He was a " koroma214 Myths and Songs. Kia karo ake Nekaia 'i ! Na Patiatoa e uuna 'i !

It was a striking homage to Christianity to see this aged man give the lie to all that had given him rank and fame amongst his countrymen during a long life, and when past the ordinary term of human life, come and sit humbly at the feet of Jesus. But when the Sabbath came for Patiatoa to partake of the tokens of His Saviour's dying love for the first time, he was too weak to walk so far. His sons extemporized a platform of a number of green branches, and carried the aged disciple to the foot of the pulpit, where he received the ordinance of the Lord's Supper for the first and last time in his long eventful life. The "second offshoot " is called "a surprise" (unuunu rako), on account of its great length, and because the weeping is continuous. The fact is, the song evinces blank, hopeless sorrow and tears from the beginning to the end. One of Vera's laments also contains a verse or two of " surprise."

Thou wast loved in the sacred streams Of Ruanuku, Rongo, and Tangaroa, Sometimes hopes of thy recovery Vainly flattered thy fnends. Again thy body wasted away, And the mouths of ancestral caves Seemed to gape for our Pukukare. The god (Motoro) of Ngariki is enraged. Wherefore this pining death, And thy flesh ever wasting away. At length thou takest a long flight Dear child, ere now thou hast reached The loftiest heights of Mount Ikurangi, Where the moon itself is devoured By the gods from Tonga and Tahiti. Thou shalt enter the presence of great Vatea. I go home now. So, too, will the king from Tonga. Thou hast entered the expanse ; And wilt visit " the-land-of-red-parrot-feathers," Where Oarangi was once a guest Thou feedest now on ocean spray, And sippest fresh water out of the rocks, Travelling over rugged cliffs, To the music of murmuring billows. Thy exile spirit is overtaken By darkness at the ocean's edge. Kourapapa there sleeps. All three * Ve&ini or, The Immortality of the Soul. 217 Tei Opapa te ngai i turuki ai Nga tokotoru.

A deceased young sister is "the third" referred to in this song, which pertains to the " death talk of Kourapapa." 8 Riuvaka was a worshipper of Tane, Hence the praises of his deity are celebrated throughout this "Introductory Song." Kirikovi was supreme temporal chief of Mangaia at the date of the discovery of the island by Captain Cook, in 1777. The "parent Tane," was "Tane-papa-kai," Le.

Wherefore the chasm of Tiki ? To shut down the natives of Avaiki (nether-world). Tueva, who seven times lamented for his boy, Asked, Why didst thou return to this world ? I came (said he) to instruct you In making food-offerings to the dead, Offerings to those in spirit-world ; Gifts from their relatives Who yet linger in this upper world. Solo. Wherefore this delay in thy dance, O Tane? Chorus. Is it a fiat of the gods? Break through it. Is it the lowering clouds of war? Dissipate them. Ha! Hal Great Papa is my (Tane's) mother. But why, Papa, didst thou descend To Avaiki, to obtain the honours of a goddess ? Ah ! thou hast shaved thy head 1 1 Should it be asked, Which of the gods Devoured our parents ? The fault is all my own. I (Tane) am a sovereign possessed of an evil spirit 1 Shaving the head was one way of mourning for the dead. Tane glories in having occasioned this mourning. This is a reference to Tane-Ngakiau, or Tane-strwmg-for-po'wer^ from Iti (Tahiti), who was believed to kill people prematurely, by devouring their souls.

Like mortals, they will come attired with sweet-scented flowers and myrtle sprigs. It is pretended that the fairy toilet is nearly complete ; the dance must for very shame lead off without delay. 2 The night of the 26th of each month was sacied to Tane ; the night following to Rongo.
