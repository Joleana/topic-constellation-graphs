The employments of mortals are mere transcripts of what was supposed to be going on in Avaiki, their knowledge and skill being derived from the invisible world. The first axe ever seen on earth (Le. Mangaia) was, handle and all, of stone from the shades. The grand secret of fire was introduced by Maui from nether-world. The female employment of cloth-beating was derived from the shedemon Mueu, who in the shades is ever beating the flail of death. The art of torch-light fishing was gained from the goddess Uti, who on damp nights loves to come up from Avaiki with a lighted torch (ignis-fatuus) to wander over the island. The art of stealing would infallibly come to grief, did not Iro himself come up on moonless nights from spirit-land, for the express purpose of assisting mortals in playing their thievish tricks. The ovens in daily use, especially the enormous ovens for cooking ti (dracoenae terminalis) roots, are derived from Mini's awful oven ever blazing in Hades. The art of war was learnt from Tukaitaua and Tutavake, denizens of nether-land. The intoxicating draught was copied from that which the hateful mistress of the invisible world presents to her victims. The pleasant and harmless game of ball-throwing was first taught to Ngaru by fairy-women ; and introduced by him to this world. Veetini came from the dead to instruct mankind how to mourn for their deceased relatives. Miscellaneous Myths, 131 An obvious explanation of this style of thought is the universal tendency of the heathen mind to trace to a supernatural source everything in earth, air, or sea. Another suggestion I would make ; their ancestors undoubtedly brought with them the knowledge of necessary and useful arts from Savai'i, the " Avaiki " and original home of these islanders. In the eastern islands they speak of having come from Hawai'i (= Savai'i), or the " Po," i.e. Night. By " Night " is intended the far-west, where the sun sets, leaving these eastern islands in darkness. Po, Hawai'i, Avaiki, and Savai'i are convertible terms. The heathen of these islands were everywhere Realists in philosophy, without knowing it This is the fundamental error of unenlightened nations. PERILS OF BEAUTY. Ngaroariki, 1 wife of Ngata, king of Rarotonga, was famed for her beauty. She was the envy of gods and men. On one occasion she was thrown into a thicket of thorns by four men, who thought she could never get out alive. (The thorns of this formidable creeper resemble fish-hooks. Woe betide the unfortunate man that gets entangled amongst them.) Tangaroa, tutelar god of Rarotonga, took pity on the hapless beauty, and sent Oroio and Roaki with long, heavy sticks to beat down the thicket, and thus afford deliverance. Another time, when rambling near the sea, she heard a siren voice calling to her, " O loveliest of women, come hither !" She felt impelled to follow the voice. The pathway led over a bua (beslaria, laurifolid) which overspread a rock. Tangaroa whispered to her to tread only the green branches, as 1 Ngaroariki = the lost queen. Ngata = difficult. 132 Myths and Songs. whoever treads upon the dead branches is necessarily bound to spirit-land. She did so. But as she passed on to the sea whence the voice proceeded, she was suddenly caught in a net by two demons, and was utterly helpless in their hands. As she was being borne away to destruction, Tangaroa again interposed on her behalf, and tore the net to pieces and delivered the fair captive. On a third occasion, Ngaroariki told her husband that she was going to bathe in a retired spot. He attempted to dissuade her from her purpose, saying that she might be attacked by the cruel hag Moto (= the striker), who was known to be jealous of her charms. Ngaroariki loved to have her own way, and went off gaily to the fountain, and there greatly diverted herself by beating the water with her hands. It happened that the envious woman was preparing cloth in her own dwelling, which was not far away from the bathing-place. As soon as she heard the splashing of the water, she knew that it was Ngaroariki, and immediately left off work and sought how she might wreak her vengeance upon the defenceless queen. Tangaroa noticed that Moto's flail ceased to beat, and concluded that she was planning some evil against Ngaroariki. Wishing to save the ill-fated beauty, he despatched his bird-messenger, the kuriri, who chirped thus : Teuteuae, 1 ruerueae, e tu ra, e oro ra, Haste, haste, arise, flee for thy life ! acre ra. The warning was repeated two or three times; but Ngaroariki paid no heed. While she was yet splashing about in the fountain, Moto violently assaulted the unprepared bather. She then, with a keen shark's tooth, shaved off the whole of her hair, which was so profuse that it made eight large handfuls. Her face was next so 1 The alliteration is beautiful : the sense of both words is the same. Miscellaneous Myths. 133 disfigured that it was impossible for any one to recognize the once beautiful queen. Her pretty yellow ear-ornament of stained fishbone, and her fine pearl-shell daintily suspended from her neck, were snatched away. Her gay clothes were all taken from her, and she was wrapped round in a single piece of old black tapa. When at length the hag Moto retreated with the spoil, poor Ngaroariki, utterly forlorn and changed in appearance, hid herself in the forest. Her husband Ngata, astonished that his queen did not return home, searched everywhere for her ; but in vain. After some time a grand reed-throwing match in honour of the king came off. The party who throws the farthest wins the day. The chief people of the island were present, and in succession threw their long reeds with various degrees of success. When Ngata and his retinue came forward to exhibit their skill, it happened that their reeds passed near where the lost queen was hiding her deformity and misery. She was wasted to a skeleton through grief and want of food. She knew well to whom the reeds belonged. One after another, as they swept past, they were caught by her and broken in pieces. It was reported to the king that his reeds had actually been destroyed by some ugly, wretched-looking woman. Ngata, greatly incensed, hastened to punish her insolence. Again and again he kicked her, reviling her for her ugliness and impudence. As soon as the king was gone, Ngaroariki wailed thus : Takatakaiia, takatakaiia te mea vaine O royal Ngata, tramplest thou thus a Ngata ariki, I Vaitakaiara te nekuere. Tramplest thou thus on thine own perishing wife ? The king was told what she had said. Was it possible that this ugly creature was indeed his lost wife? He immediately 134 Myths and Songs. returned and looked attentively at her face, but could see no likeless to his beloved Ngaroariki. Yet there could be no mistaking e meaning of her words. At last he bethought himself to open ier mouth ; and, on doing so, immediately recognized the pearly ;eeth of his lost one. He asked what had happened to her. She .old him all Off started Ngata, followed by his wife, in search of lie sorceress. She was employed as usual in beating out cloth. The king demanded whether she had touched Ngaroariki and had stolen her queenly ornaments. The hag admitted that these :harges were true, but begged the king not to kill her, as she rould give back the stolen treasures, and restore her to her mstine beauty. The ornaments and clothing were produced. The orceress then collected the viscid fluid of the hibiscus and the >ronga (urtica argented), and prepared a sort of gum which she Mastered all over the bald head of Ngaroariki. The hair was hus made by the sorceress to adhere as formerly. The eyebrows fere restored in the same way. The hag having, with infinite ibour, repaired the damage she had done to the person of the [ueen, hoped to be forgiven. But Ngata thirsted for revenge. Besides, the jealous Moto might invent some new method of ijuring his beloved one. Without heeding her entreaties for lercy, the king stoned the sorceress to death, as he believed. Lccompanied by Ngaroariki, he was proceeding home, when, to is utter astonishment, he heard Moto again at her old employxent, beating out native cloth. He returned to the hag, who ppeared to be uninjured by what had occurred. A second time Fgata stoned the sorceress ; but again she revived and returned > her old work. Driven to his wits' end, he at last hit upon a Ian which proved successful; it was to stone her until, as reviously, life seemed extinct, and then to sever the limbs and Miscellaneous Myths. 135 bury them in different parts of the island. Thus, at length, an end was put to the malicious tricks of the envious Moto, and the lovely Ngaroariki lived in peace with her royal husband. ORIGIN OF PIGS AT RAROTONGA. Of the seven islands constituting the Hervey Group, Mangaia and Aitutaki are the only ones without a native breed of pigs. The first were landed in 1823 by the martyr Williams. On occasion of the annual May festivities in 1852, a thousand pigs were killed and eaten ! Of late years the number of these useful animals has greatly fallen off, owing to the desolation occasioned by successive hurricanes. The only quadruped previously known on Mangaia was thera/, which was considered to be delicious eating. To this day a rathunt is rare sport for boys, who afterwards divide the spoil. Their seniors have relinquished the practice of rat-eating. " As sweet as a rat " is a common proverb ; and the Rarotongans revile Mangaians as " rat-eaters." The following is the legend given to account for the origin of pigs at Rarotonga : Some two miles from the settlement of Avarua is a place named Kupolu, where there once lived the aged blind Maaru, and his son Kationgia. They lived by themselves in a pleasant spot, not far from the base of mountains whose summits are nearly always robed in clouds. In consequence of the continual fighting of those days, there was a most severe famine. Maaru became too feeble to stir from the house ; so that the boy had to provide, as best he could, for the wants of the old man and himself. Kationgia could find nothing better to eat than the stump of the banana, which 136 Myths and Songs. ordinarily no one would condescend to taste. Very diligently did he grate these stumps on a lump of madrepore coral, strain off the farina into a tub hollowed out of a solid tree, and mixing a little of the refuse (ota), in order to give it substance, cooked the whole in the oven. Kationgia would now go on the reef to fish, in order to get something to render this wretched diet palatable. The fish, when obtained, was grilled over a fire, on an extempore gridiron of green cocoa-nut branches. The dutiful son invariably gave to his aged parent the bananaroot pudding and the larger fish, whilst he satisfied the cravings of his own appetite on sea-slugs and shell-fish. Maaru, wearied of this diet, and suspected Kationgia of playing him a trick. Possibly the secret of his boy's uncomplaining cheerfulness was that he reserved all the good things for his own eating, knowing that his old father was stone blind. Resolved to find out the truth, he waited till his son had gone on the reef to fish. Maaru now felt about for the calabash of salt water, and spilled its contents. In due time the son returned with some fish, and prepared their meal. But to his surprise, the salt water was gone. Without a word of complaint the lad started back to the beach to refill the empty calabash with this indispensable condiment. This was just the opportunity the old blind father desired. Everything was spread for his own dinner and for his son's : he resolved to ascertain what his boy was living on from day to day, seeing that his own fare was so indifferent To his grief he found that Kationgia had been really starving himself, whilst the father had constantly eaten the only tolerable food obtainable. Maaru wept at the thought of what his poor boy had endured for his sake : hearing, at length, the footsteps of the lad, he restrained his tears. M^scellaneo^t,s Myths. 137 The meal was finished in silence. The old man then requested Kationgia to come to him. The boy obeyed, wondering at this novel proceeding. The blind Maaru then felt all over his person, and found him to be a living skeleton. Father and son now wept together. Kationgia was told to prepare an oven. " What have we to cook?" naturally asked the son. The father repeated his command. When the oven was nearly ready, Maaru directed his son to dig about the posts of the house, where he had, with a wise forethought, during a previous season of plenty, concealed a quantity of food against the time of scarcity. Near the first post was a large quantity of " mii," or sour bread-fruit, carefully packed up in leaves. 1 About the second post was a lot of excellent chestnuts (tuscarpus edulis). To crown the whole, a bunch of four cocoa-nuts was discovered close to the third principal support of their dwelling. Said the old father, " Cook all this food ; for we will have a feast to-night. When I am gone, dig about all the minor posts of this house, and you will find plenty of food expressly reserved for this time of sore need." That evening father and son enjoyed the luxury of a second meal. Maaru then solemnly said, " I have eaten my last food. I am about to die. As soon as the breath is out of my body, take me to Nikao (a good fishing-place about a mile distant). On no account carry me ; but drag me there. Conceal my body in the bush ; cover it well with leaves and grass. At the expiration of four days, come and look at my body. Should you see worms crawling about, cover me over again with fresh leaves and grass. At the expiration of another four days come back and something 1 Thus packed and buried in the earth, it will keep good two or three years. 138 Myths and Songs. will follow you. Peace will be restored to this island, and you will be king /" That same night the old man died. Kationgia faithfully carried out the last wish of his parent The bruised corpse was deposited in the dense ironwood forest, not far from the beautiful white sandy beach of Nikao. At the end of four days the lad revisited the sequestered grave, and saw worms crawling about According to the instructions of Maaru, he gathered abundance of fresh leaves and grass, and piled them over the corpse to a great height But when, after the expiration of another four days, he paid a second visit to the grave, he was surprised to see the entire mass strangely heaving ; it was all commotion ! Alarmed at this, he rushed away home in horror. His ears, however, were assailed and his steps arrested with the novel grunts of the first brood of pigs on Rarotonga. In that first brood were all the varieties of white, black, and speckled, which have since prevailed These young pigs, of their own accord, followed Kationgia to his home at the foot of the mountain. They increased at a wonderful rate, and made their owner famous all over the island. Being now a man of consideration, Kationgia married to advantage. Peace prevailed, and eventually, on account of his owning these wonderful animals, he was elected king ! Such was the reward of his filial piety. To the present day pigs at Rarotonga are, in allusion to this story, called " e iro no Maaru " = worms of Maaru. Kationgia = bite and smell, as if the model child of their heathen antiquity only bit and smelt his own share of food, A spot at Rarotonga is to this day called Kupolu. Miscellaneous Myths. 139 SEEKING FOR LIGHT. AN AITUTAKIAN MYTH. Te-erui, son of Te-tareva = the expanse, lived long in utter darkness in the shades (Avaiki). He had heard that there was somewhere a land of light ; very earnestly he desired to visit it. He ruminated as to the best way of attaining his purpose, and finally resolved to make a canoe, in which he might paddle away to " the land of light" Te-erui divulged his secret purpose to his brother Matareka = smiling face. Being of one mind, they at once set off in search of suitable wood for their purpose. As they felled the trees, they chanted these words : Nga Te-erui, nga Matareka e amo i te toki i te tumu o te rakau. E aumapu ma taku toki, e aumapu. Te end and Matareka have brought their axes to the root of this tree. Merrily rings the axe ! merrily O 1 The trees fell. The top and branches were speedily lopped off, the outer bark was peeled off, and the trunks hollowed out into two fine canoes. The outriggers were secured. The first canoe was named, "Weary of Darkness ;" the second, "Sleepless Nights." These enterprising brothers dragged their canoes to the ocean's edge, set up a mast and sail in each, and started for the much-wished-for " land of light" When the winds grew light, they diligently plied their paddles. On and on they went, and, to their great joy, reached a region called " Glimmering of Light" Here they met with a great misfortune their canoes upset. They, however, swam back for their lives, and succeeded in reaching their homes again. In no degree discouraged by the 140 Myths and Songs. result of this, their first experiment, the brothers cut down two trees, chanting as before : Te-erui and Matareka have brought their axes to the root of this tree. Merrily rings the axe ! merrily O I The trees fell ; and in due time the canoes were completed. One was named, "Unalterable Purpose;" the other, "Sidle Along " (because unable to go direct). These new canoes were launched, and a second time the brothers started off in search oi " the land of light" All went on well until they arrived at the comparatively pleasant region of " Glimmering of Light," where their fragile barks were sunk: by the violence of the waves. The adventurous voyagers happily succeeded in swimming back to shore a second time. But Te-erui and Matareka did not despair. Again they felled timber for two new canoes in the place of those they had lost, singing as before : Te-enti and Matareka have brought, etc. When these canoes were completed, they were respectively called " Tack In," and " Tack Out." Once more the brothers, each in a separate canoe, started off in search of "the land of light," but were again doomed to disappointment ; for, on reaching the region of "Glimmering of Light," the rough waves again broke up their canoes. Te-erui and Matareka, however, got back to shore a third time. The brothers now doubted whether they would ever succeed in getting to the wished-for land. They resolved to try once more. Again they selected the best trees for their purpose; and, whilst cutting them down, sang as formerly, "Te-erui and Matareka," eta When these canoes were completed, they held a consultation as to the probable cause of their previous failures. Miscellaneous Myths. 141 The carpenter, or priest, inquired the name of the masts of the former canoes. The brothers replied, " Te-tira-o-Rongo," *>, The mast of Rongo. The carpenter remarked, "It is on this account that you have hitherto failed. Change the name, and you will yet succeed." "What name do you propose ? " asked the brothers. " Call it," said the priest-carpenter, " O-tu-i-te-rangi-marama " r = Erect in the Light of Heaven. This was gladly agreed to. Everything was at length completed for the fourth expedition in search of " the land of light." What with paddling and sailing, they reached the dangerous region of " Glimmering of Light," and saw the mad billows seemingly resolved again to swallow up the frail barks. But " Erect in the Light of Heaven " kept on through storm and calm until they reached "the land of light" a region where they could clearly see each other ; where the sun shone brightly, and all was pleasant No more caring to return to the dark land from which they had originally set out, they looked about for a resting-place, and at last espied a half-sunken island ahead. But the ocean waves were threatening, and the surf rolled heavily against the coral reef. The brothers fought against these billows, and lo ! the sea became smooth. Nearing the partially submerged island, they could find no dry place on which to set their feet The brothers again contended with the ocean ; the shallow waters vanished, leaving the island elevated far above the surrounding ocean. Te-erui and Matareka took possession of their new-found home in "the region of light," and thenceforth appropriately called it " Aitu-taki " God-led. Such is the legendary history of the " Adam " of Aitutaki. It is, of course, a highly exaggerated account of the voyage of the 1 A possible meaning of this name is "Tu-(bathed)-in-the-Light-of-Heaven." I prefer that given in the text. 142 Myths and Songs. first settlers from Avaiki Savai'i, the sun-setting, to " the land of light," i,e. the sun-rising. Said the heathen priests to Papehia, one of their first teachers, " Te-erui was the first man ; we know nothing about your Adam." RATA'S CANOE. A LEGEND FROM AITUTAKI. In the fairy land of Kupolu lived the renowned chief Rata, who resolved to build a great double canoe, with a view of exploring other lands. Shouldering his axe, he started off to a distant valley where the finest timber grew. Close to the mountain stream stood a fragrant pandanus tree, where a deadly combat was going on between a beautiful white heron (ruru), and a spotted sea-serpent (aa). The origin of the quarrel was as follows : The heron was accustomed, when wearied with its search after fish, to rest itself on a stone rising just above the waters of the coral reef, and chanced to defile the eyes of a monstrous seaserpent, whose hole was just beneath. The serpent, greatly enraged at this insult, resolved to be revenged. Raising its head as far as possible out of the water, it carefully observed the flight of the white heron and followed in pursuit. Leaving the salt water of the reef, it entered the mountain torrent, and eventually reached the foot of the fragrant pandanus, where the unconscious' victim was sleeping. The sea-serpent easily climbed the pandanus by means of one of its extraordinary aerial supports or roots ; and now, holding on firmly with its twisted tail, began the attack by biting the lovely bird. They fought hard all through that night. At dawn, the white heron seeing Rata passing that way, plaintively called out, " Rata, put an end to this fight." But the sea-serpent said deceitMiscellaneous Myths. 143 fully, " Nay, Rata ; leave us alone. It is but a trial of strength between a heron and a serpent. Let us fight it out." Again the white heron begged Rata to interfere ; and again the crafty seaserpent bade Rata go on his way which he did, being in a great hurry to fell timber for his canoe. But as he walked heedlessly along, he heard the bird say reproachfully, " Ah ! your canoe will not be finished without my aid" Still Rata heeded not the white heron's cry for help, but entered the recesses of the forest. Selecting the finest timber he could find, he cut down enough for his purpose, and at sunset returned home. Early on the following morning the chief returned to the valley, intending to hollow out the trees he had felled on the previous day. Strangely enough, the logs were missing : not a lopped branch, or even a chip or a leaf could be seen ! No stump could be discovered, so that it was evident that the felled trees had, in the course of the night, been mysteriously restored to their former state. But Rata was not to be deterred from his purpose, so having again fixed upon suitable trees, a second time he levelled them to the ground. On the third morning, as he went back to the forest to his work, he noticed that the heron and the serpent were still fighting. They had been thus engaged for two days and nights without intermission. Rata pursued his way, intending to hollow out his canoe, when to his astonishment, as on the previous day, the fallen trees had resumed their original places, and were in every respect as perfect as before the axe had touched them. Rata guessed by their position and size, which were the trees that had twice served him this trick. He now for the first time understood the meaning of what the suffering white heron had said to him on the first day, " Your canoe will not be finished without my aid." 144 Myths and Songs. Rata now left the forest and went to see whether the white heron was alive. The beautiful bird was indeed living, but very much exhausted. Its unrelenting foe, sure of victory, was preparing for a final attack when Rata chopped it in pieces with his axe, and thus saved the life of the white heron. He then went back to his work, and for the third time felled the timber for his canoe. As it was by this time growing dark, he returned home to rest. From the branch of a distant tree the somewhat revived white heron watched the labours of Rata through the livelong day. As soon as the chief had disappeared in the evening, the grateful bird started off to collect all the birds of Kupolu to hollow out Rata's canoe. They gladly obeyed the summons of their sovereign, and pecked away with their beaks until the huge logs were speedily hollowed out. Next came the more difficult task of joining together the separate pieces. The holes were bored with the long bills of the sea birds, and the cinet was well secured with the claws of the stronger land birds. It was almost dawn ere the work was completed. Finally, they resolved to convey the canoe to the beach close to Rata's dwelling. To accomplish this, each bird the small as well as the large took its place on either side of the canoe, completely surrounding it. At a given signal they all extended their wings, one to bear up the canoe, the other for flight. As they bore the canoe through the air they sang, each with a different note, as follows : E ara rakau e ! E ara rakau e ! A pathway for the canoe ! A pathway for the canoe ! E ara inano e I A path of sweet-scented flowers ! E kopukopu te tini o Kupolu , The entire family of birds of Kupolu E matakitaki, ka re koe ! 06 ! Honour thee (Rata) above all mortals! 06! Miscellaneous Myths. 145 On reaching the sandy beach in front of Rata's dwelling the canoe was carefully deposited by the birds, who now quickly disappeared in the depths of the forest Awakened by this unwonted song of the birds, Rata hastily collected his tools, intending to return to his arduous employment in the valley. At this moment he caught sight of the famous canoe, beautifully finished off, lying close to his door. He at once guessed this to be the gratitude of the king of birds, and named the canoe " Taraipo " = JBuftt-in-a-nigJit (or Built-in4JieRata speedily provided his bird-built canoe with a mast and a sail, and then summoned his friends, and laid in food and water for his projected voyage. Everything being now ready, he went on board, and was just starting when Nganaoa asked permission to go in this wonderful vessel. But Rata would not consent. The crafty Nganaoa seeing the canoe start without him ran to fetch an empty calabash, knocked off the top, and squeezing himself in as best he could, floated himself off on the surface of the ocean, unti] he got a little ahead of the canoe. The people in Rata's canoe were surprised to see an apparently empty calabash floating steadily just before their vessel. Rata desired one of his men tc stoop down to pick up the calabash, as it might prove useful, The man did so, but to his astonishment found it very heavy actually containing a man compressed into the smallest possible compass. A voice now issued from the calabash, O Rata, take me 01 board your canoe." "Whither away?" inquired the chief " I go," said the poor fellow inside the calabash, " warned by ai oracle, to the land' of Moonlight, to seek my parents Tairitokerai and Vaiaroa." Rata now asked, "What will you do for me i L 146 Myths and Songs. I take you in ? " The imprisoned Nganaoa replied, " I will look after your mat sail." " I do not want your help," said Rata. " Here are men enough to attend to the great mat sail." After a pause, Nganaoa, still unreleased from his awkward position, again earnestly addressed Rata : "Let me go in your canoe." " Whither away ? " again demanded the chief. " I go," said Nganaoa, "warned by an oracle, to the land of Moonlight, to seek my parents Tairitokerau and Vaiaroa." Rata again asked " What now will you do for me if I take you in ? " The reply issued from the calabash, " I will unweariedly bale out the water from the bottom of your canoe." Again Rata said, " I do not want your help. I have plenty of men to bale out the water from the bottom of the canoe." A third time, in similar terms, Nganaoa entreated permission to go jin the canoe to paddle it whenever the wind should grow light or adverse. But Rata would not accept his services. At last, upon the fourth application, the desponding Nganaoa was successful, on the promise to destroy all the monsters of the ocean which might infest their path. Rata wisely reflected that he had "entirely forgotten to provide against this emergency; and who so fertile in expedients as Nganaoa, who was now permitted to emerge from his calabash, and to take his place armed at head of the canoe to be on the look-out for monsters. Swiftly and pleasantly, with a fair wind, they sped over the ocean in quest of new lands. One day Nganaoa shouted, "O Rata, here is a terrible foe starting up from the main." It was an open dam of fearful proportions. One shell was ahead, the other astern the canoe and all on board lying between ! In another moment this horrid clam might crush them all by suddenly closing its mouth ! But Nganaoa was ready for the emergency. He Miscellaneous Myths. 147 seized his long spear and quickly drove it down into the fish, so that the bivalve instead of suddenly snapping them all up sank immediately to the bottom of the ocean. This danger escaped, they again sped pleasantly on their way. But after a while the voice of the ever vigilant Nganaoa was heard : "0 Rata, yonder is a terrible enemy starting up from ocean depths." It proved to be an octopus of extraordinary dimensions. Its huge tentacula encircled the vessel in their embrace, threatening to destroy them. At this critical juncture Nganaoa seized his spear and fearlessly drove it through the head of the octopus. The tentacula now slowly relaxed, and the dead monster floated off on the surface of the ocean. Again they pursued their voyage in safety. But one more great peril awaited them. One day the brave Nganaoa shouted, " O Rata, here is a great whale /" Its enormous mouth was wide open ; one jaw beneath the canoe, and the other above it ! The whale was evidently bent on swallowing them up alive. Nganaoa, the slayer of monsters, now broke his long spear in two, and at the critical moment when the whale was about to crush them all, he cleverly inserted both stakes inside the mouth of their foe, so that it became impossible for it to close its jaws. Nganaoa nimbly jumped inside the mouth of this great whale and looked down into the stomach, and lo ! there sat his long lost father Tairitokerau and his mother Vaiaroa, who had been swallowed alive when fishing by this monster of the deep. The oracle was fulfilled ; his voyage was prosperous. The parents of Nganaoa were busily engaged in platting cinet Great was their joy at seeing their son, being assured that deliverance was at hand. Nganaoa resolved, whilst extricating his parents, to be fully revenged upon the whale. He therefore 148 Myths and Songs, extracted one of the two stakes the remaining one sufficing to prevent the monster from enclosing him as well as his parents in this living tomb. Breaking this prop into two pieces, he converted them into fire-sticks. He desired his father to hold firmly the lower one, whilst he worked assiduously with the upper stick, until at length the fire smouldered. Blowing it to a flame, Nganaoa set fire to the fatty portion of the stomach. The monster, writhing in agony, sought relief in swimming to the nearest land, where, on reaching the sandy beach, father, mother, and son quietly walked out through the open mouth of the stranded and dying whale. The island proved to be Iti-te-marama, or Moonlight. Here the canoe of Rata was drawn up on the beach, and for a time they all lived pleasantly. They daily refreshed themselves with its fruits and fish, adorning their persons with fragrant flowers. At length they longed for the land of their birth in Avaiki, and they resolved to return. The canoe was repaired and launched ; food and water were laid in j the great mat sail was set up, and at length the brave navigator Rata, with the scarcely saved parents of Nganaoa, and the entire party, started once more. After many days, but without further peril, they eventually reached their original homes in the lands of the sunsetting. This myth materially differs from the Rarotongan one, to which Mr. Williams refers in the " Enterprises " (chap, xiii.), which relates how Tangiia first came to Rarotonga, In the latter part, one is strongly reminded of the story of Jonah : the natives look upon it as a distorted version of the Bible narrative. The myth says " a whale " (toora) swallowed the parents of Nganaoa ; Miscellaneous Myths. 149 whereas the native Bible merely states that "a great fish" (ika maata) swallowed Jonah. This myth, which may be regarded as one of the primitive stories of the race, points to Samoa. At Pangaroa, in the island of Upolu (in Rarotongan and Aitutakian story JTupolu; but in Mangaian traditions 7upolu), amid some rocks near the sea, is a block of stone, about twenty-seven feet in length, very much resembling a canoe, and called " the canoe of Rata !

The objection to the former is, that is is purely a roamer over the ocean. The fish intended is the "vaaroa," or spotted sea-serpent, which attains the length of eight feet, and is very vindictive. It may seem incredible that a species of eel should climb trees, but such nevertheless is said (by the natives) to be the fact On low coral islands, where the pandanus grows close to the lagoon, it is common for this fish to make its way over the sand and broken coral until, reaching the shafts which support the trunk, it climbs with great ease in search of lizards which sleep on the branches.

HADES; OR, THE DOCTRINE OF SPIRIT-WORLD. THE proper name for Hades is Avaiki ; in Tahitian, Hawai'i ; in New Zealand, Hawaiki. Many other expressions occur in their ancient songs and myths, but they are to be regarded as designations for places or territories in Avaiki, the vast hollow over which the island is supposed to be placed. As the dead were usually thrown down the deepest chasms, it was not unnatural for their friends to imagine the earth to be hollow, and the entrance to this vast nether-world to be down one of these pits. No one can wonder at this who knows that the outer portion of Mangaia is a honeycomb, the rock being pierced in every direction with winding caves and frightful chasms. It is asserted that the Mission premises at Oneroa are built over one of these great caverns, which extends so far towards the sea that the beating of the surf can be distinctly heard, whilst the water, purified from its saline particles, continually drips from the stony roof. The Hades; or, The Doctrine of Spirit-World. 153 inland opening to this subterranean territory was the grand repository of the dead, and is known by the significant name of 3SL. THE UNIVERSE, ACCORDING TO THE IDEAS OF THE NATIVES OF MANGAIA. 154 Myths and Songs. Doubtless this is the true origin of their idea of the whereabouts of spirit-world. The proper denizens of Avaiki are the major and lesser divinities, with their dependants. These marry, multiply, and quarrel like mortals. They wear clothing, plant, cook, fish, build, and inhabit dwellings of exactly the same sort as exist on earth. The food of immortals is no better than that eaten by mankind. The story of Kura's marvellous escape from Hades represents some districts of spirit-land as inhabited by cannibals, whose delight is to entrap unwary mortals to their destruction it is to be presumed without the knowledge of dread Miru. Birds, fish, and rats ; the mantis, beetle, and centipede ; the cocoa-nut tree, the pandanus, the myrtle, the morindo dtrifolia> and the yam, all abound in Hades, either for the support or adornment of immortals. Murder, adultery, drunkenness, theft, and lying are practised by them. The arts of this world are fac-similes of what primarily belonged to nether-land, and were taught to mankind by the gods. The visible world itself is but a gross copy of what exists in spirit-land. If fire burns, it is because latent flame was hidden in the wood by Mauike in Hades. If the axe cleaves, it is because the fairy of the axe is invisibly present. If the ironwood club kills its victim, it is because a fierce demon from Tonga is enshrined in it At a spot named Aremauku, about half a mile from the principal village, on a cliff overhanging the western ocean, it was pretended that the direct road to spirit-land existed. Through it continual communication was anciently kept up with Hades. By this route Maui descended to the home of Mauike, and wrested the secret of fire. In one district lived a race possessed of only one eye apiece ! At evening the Sun-god Ra drops down through Hades ; or, The Doctrine of Spirit-World. 155 the opening made for his convenience at the edge of the horizon, and thus lights up the inhabitants of the nether-world. One myth asserts that he descends thus frequently to Avaiki to visit his wife TV,) who lives with the Great Mother Vari, at the very bottom of the vast cocoa-nut hollow knees and chin meeting ! Hence the ancient proverb, "Day here; night in Avaiki" and vice versa. As the priest Teka sang (1794) : Ua po Avaiki 'Tis night now in spirit-land ; Ua ao nunga nei. For 'tis light in this upper world At the appointed interval, the Sun-god Ra climbs up, not without great difficulty, out of nether-world through a hole at the edge of the eastern horizon, and lights up Mangaia. That his movements are so reasonable and regular is due to the exertions of Maui, The high-road to Avaiki is for ever closed This was not the fault of mankind, but the penalty of the excesses of the denizens of spirit-land. They became very troublesome to mankind continually afflicting them with disease and death. They occasioned great dearth by stealing all kinds of food, and even ravished the women of this world. The brave and beautiful Tiki, the sister of Veetini, determined to put an end to these annoyances. For this purpose she rolled herself alive down into the gloomy opening, which immediately closed upon her. From that memorable day the spirits of mortals have been compelled to descend to Avaiki by a different route. Happily, however, the natives of Avaiki no longer dare molest mankind The closed chasm is known by the name u te rua ia Tiki " = Tiki's hole. The spirits of the dead were often spoken of as wandering along the margin of the sea most disconsolately; not a little 156 Myths and Songs. annoyed at the extreme sharpness of the rocks, and the entanglement of their feet in the bindweed and thick vines. They were arrayed in ghostly net-work, and a fantastic mourning of weeds picked upon the way, relieved, however, by the fragrant heliotrope which grows freely on the barren rocks. A red creeper, resembling dyed twine, wound round and round the head like a turban, completed their ghostly toilet Rather inconsistently with this, a smooth, shelving piece of coral rock on the western coast is known as " te renanga a te atua," le. the place where ghosts blanch their new-made garments; as if during the weary months of their wanderings over the rough rocks they were driven, like the living, to prepare new clothing from time to time, and thus replace the garments torn by the bushes and thorny creepers. Was it to assist in the manufacture of such garments that females were invariably buried with one or more cloth mallets used in life? The great delight of these weeping, melancholy spirits, was to follow the sun. 1 At the summer solstice, January, he apparently rises out of the ocean opposite to Ana-knra (the "red-cave," so called as receiving the red rays of the morning) ; at the winter solstice, June, rising at Karanga-iti (" the little welcome," winter being but half welcome). These points became, therefore, grand rendezvous of disembodied spirits : those belonging to the northern half of the island assembling at the last-named rendezvous, Karanga-iti ; those, by far the greater number, belonging to the southern half of the island meeting at the former, Ana-kura. Many months might elapse ere the projected departure of the ghosts took place. This weary interval was spent in dances and 1 The dead, if buried at all, were buried with tlie feet towards the setting sun, on account of this ancient solar worship. Hades ; or, The Doctrine of SpiritWorld. 157 in revisiting their former homes, where the living dwell affectionately remembered by the dead. At night-fall they would wander amongst the trees and plantations nearest to these dwellings, sometimes venturing to peep inside. As a rule, these ghosts were well-disposed to their own living relatives ; but often became vindictive if a pet child was ill-treated by a step-mother or other relatives, etc. Sometimes wearied with these wanderings, the ghosts huddled together in the Red-cave, the stony base of which is constantly laved by the waves of the Pacific, rolling in with terrific violence from the east Or, if it so pleased their fancy, they clambered up the open, lawn-like place above the cave, out of reach of the billows and foam of the ocean (now a favourite resting-place for fishermen, where they cook and eat part of their finny spoil). This open grassy space, so renowned in their songs and myths concerning the dead, is known as " One-ma-kenu-kenu " = THE smooth spot, or the well-weeded spot. A coarse species of grass covers the sandy soil, pleasingly contrasting with the utter barrenness beyond, where Desolation seems to be enthroned. The precise period for final departure was fixed by the leader of the band. But if no distinguished person was amongst them, they must of course wait on until such a leader was obtained. Thus in the beautiful classic laments for Vera, he is represented as the chosen captain of the dead, as his uncle Nagara ruled over the living about 125 years ago. The chief of this disconsolate throng resolves to depart Messages are sent to collect those stray ghosts who may yet be lingering near their ancient haunts. With many tears and last lingering looks they assemble at the Red-cave, or on the grassy lawn above it, intently watching the rising of the sun. At the 158 Myths and Songs. first streak of dawn the entire band take their departure to meet the rising sun. This done, they follow in his train as nearly as may be : he in the heavens above, they at first on the ocean beneath, but afterwards over the rocks and stones (always avoiding the interior of the island), 1 until late in the afternoon of the appointed day they are all assembled at Vairorongo, facing the setting sun. " Vairorongo " means " Kongo's sacred stream." It is a little rivulet rushing out of the stones at the marae of Rongo, where in the olden time only the priests and kings might bathe. At last the congregated throng, whose eyes are fixed upon the setting sun, feel that the moment has come when they must for ever depart from the cherished scenes of earth despite the tears and solicitations of relatives, who are frequently represented as chasing their loved ones over rocks and across fearful precipices, round half the island. The sun now sinks in the ocean, leaving a golden track j the entire band of ghosts take a last farewell, and following their earthly leader, flit over the ocean in the train of the Sun-god Ra, but not like him destined to reappear on the morrow. The ghostly train enter Avaiki through the very aperture by which the Sun-god descends in order to lighten up for a time those dark subterranean regions. This view is expressed in the beautiful myth of Ve&ini. After the crowd of spirits had taken their departure, a solitary laggard might sometimes be left behind arriving at the appointed rendezvous only in time to see the long annual train disappear with the glowing sun. The unhappy ghost must wait 1 The rocks encircling the island and near the sea were the home of the vanquished in battle, too often hunted or starved to death ; also the temporary home of these exile spirits. Hades; or, The Doctrine of Spirit-World. 159 till a new troop be formed for the following winter, its only amusement being " to dance the dance of the tiitii, or starved ! " or to " toss pebbles in the air " through the weary months that intervene. The point of departure for spirit-land is called a "reinga vaerua." There are three on Mangaia, all facing the setting sun. The boundary of the Mission premises at Oneroa is marked on one side by a bluff rock standing out by itself like a giant facing the west. It was believed that the spirits of those buried in that grand repository of the dead " Auraka," at the proper season left its gloomy, winding subterranean passages and divided themselves into two bands : the majority starting from " Araia " and lodging on the fatal bua tree; some those issuing from "Kauava" going in mournful procession to the projecting rock alluded to, thence leapt one by one to a second and much smaller block of stone resting on the inner edge of the reef, and thence again to the outer and extreme edge of the reef on which the surf ceaselessly beats. From this point they take their final departure to the shades in the track of the sun. At Atua-koro, on the north-west coast of the island, are two great stones very similarly placed by the hand of nature. This was considered to be an arrangement for the convenience of ghosts on that part of the island. Like the former these stones are known as " Reinga vaerua," Le. Leafing-flace-of-souh ! These are but trifling modifications of the highly poetical representation of disembodied spirits, NOT the slain, being impelled to follow in the train of the setting sun to spirit-land. At Rarotonga the great "reinga" or "rereanga vaerua" was at Tuoro j on the west of the island, as at Mangaia. So, too, in all 160 Myths and Songs. the other islands of the group. At Samoa, a spirit leaving the dead body at the most easterly island of that group would be compelled to traverse the entire series of islands, passing the channels between at given points, ere it could descend to the subterranean spirit-world at the most westerly point of Savai'L However, the standard and esoteric z teaching of the priests was that the souls of the dying leave the body ere breath is quite extinct, and travel to the edge of the cliff at Araia (= hindered, 01 sent back) near the marae of Kongo, and facing the west. li a friendly spirit should meet the solitary wanderer at any point of the sad but inevitable journey from the place where the seemingly dead body lies, and should say, " Go back and live," the now joyful ghost at once returns to its old home and re-inhabits the once forsaken body. This is the native theory <& fainting. But if no friendly spirit interfere, the departing soul pursues its mournful travels and eventually reaches the extreme edge of the cliff. Instantly a large wave (the sea is about 100 yards distant) approaches to the base, and at the same moment a gigantic lua tree (beslaria laurifolia)^ covered with fragrant blossom springs^ up from Avaiki to receive on its far-reaching branches unhappy human spirits. Even at this last moment, with feet almost touching the fatal tree, a friendly voice may send the spirittraveller back to life and health. Otherwise, he is mysteriously impelled to climb the particular branch reserved for his own tribe and conveniently brought nearest to him. The worshippers oi 1 The difference is merely as to the mode of access to the shades, whethei by following the setting sun, or by climbing on a branch of the mysterious bua tree. In eithfr case the END of all who die a natural death is to be cooked and eaten by Mini, her children and followers. Hades; or, The Doctrine of Spirit-World. 161 Motoro have a branch to themselves, the worshippers of Tane have another the tree in question having just as many branches as there are principal gods in Mangaia The whole batch of lesser Tanes congregate on one great branch, etc., etc. Immediately the human soul is safely lodged upon this gigantic tree, the bua goes down with its living burden to nether-world. While yet on the tree the wretched spirit looks down to the root, and to his horror sees a great net spread out beneath to catch it 1 This net, from the strong meshes of which there is no escape, is firmly held by Akaanga and his assistants. The doomed spirit at last falls into this fatal net, and is at once submerged in a lake of fresh water which lies near the foot of the gigantic bua tree and bears the name of Vai-roto-ariki = the-royal-fresh-water-lake. la these treacherous waters captive ghosts exhaust themselves by wriggling like fishes in the vain hope of escape. The great net is eventually pulled up, and the half-drowned spirits tremblingly enter the presence of the inexpressibly ugly Mini, generally called " the rucfdy " (Mini Kura), because her face reflects the glowing heat of her ever-burning oven. The hag feeds her unwilling visitors with red earth-worms, black beetles, crabs, and small blackbirds. The grand secret of Mini's power over her intended victims is the " kava " root (piper mythisiicum). It consists of one vast root, and is named by her "Tevoo," being her own peculiar property. The three sorts of "kava" known in the upper world were originally branches off this enormous root ever-growing in 1 Hence the proverb in regard to the dying, " Ka ei i roto i te kupenga tini mata varu " = " Will be caught in the net of innumerable meshes" i.e. the net of Akaanga. It is curious that the proverb should outlive the faith on which it was founded. 1 62 Myths and Songs. Avaiki Mini's four lovely daughters are directed to prepare bowls of this strong kava for her unwilling visitors. Utterly stupefied with the draught, the unresisting victims are borne off to the oven and cooked. Mini, with her son and peerless daughters, subsist on these human spirits. The refuse is thrown to her servants, Akaanga and others. Such is the inevitable fate of those who die a natural death, i.e. of women, cowards, and children. They are annihilated* Not so warriors slain on the field of battle. The spirits of these lucky fellows for a while wander about amongst the rocks and trees in the neighbourhood of which their bodies were thrown, the ghastly wounds by which they met their fate being still visible. A species of cricket, rarely seen, but whose voice is continually heard at night plaintively chirping "kere-kerere-tao-tao," was believed to be the voice of these warrior spirits sorrowfully calling to their friends. Hence the proverb, " The spirit-cricket is chirping " (Kua tangi te vava). At length the first slain on each battlefield would collect his brother ghosts at a place a short distance beyond Araia (the point of departure for those who perish by sickness), still on the edge of the cliff, and facing the setting sun. It overlooks the marae of Rongo, the god of battles. Indeed, one extraordinary myth represents Rongo as coming up from nether-world at certain periods in order to feast himself upon the spirits of those slain in battle assembled for their last journey. With bits of ripe banana Rongo tempts them to his side, and then treacherously swallows them whole ! But these ghosts have the consolation of escaping the fire of Mini : besides, they are eventually disengaged alive from the intestines of the 1 Some "wise men" will have it that these spirits live again after passing through the intestines of Mini and her followers. Hades ; or, The Doctrine of Spirit-World. 163 grim war-god. They at last rise to the upper sky and join their warrior brethren there. But the more pleasing version represents these ghosts as lingering awhile on the cliff. Suddenly a mountain springs up at their feet The road by which they ascend this mountain is over the spears and clubs by which they were slain. Arrived at the summit, they leap into the blue expanse, thus becoming the peculiar clouds of the winter (or dry) season. These clouds are to be distinguished from the ordinary rain clouds. The warrior spirits of past ages, as well as those recently slain, together constitute the dark clouds of morning which for a while intercept the bright rays of the sun throughout the year. During the rainy season they cannot ascend to the warrior's Paradise. In June, the first month of winter, the atmosphere is pervaded by these ghosts, to whom the chilliness of death still clings. Their great number hides the sun for days together, occasioning the dull heavy sky, dullness and oppression of spirits usual at that season of the year. This lasts till the beginning of August, when the coral tree opens its blood-red blossoms, and the sky becomes mottled, and light fleecy clouds pass over the heavens. It it the spirits of the brave dead preparing for their flight The heavens soon become cloudless ; the weather bright and warm. It is because they have taken their departure. The living now resume their ordinary avocations in comfort. The spirits of those who die a natural death are excessively feeble and weak, as their bodies were at dissolution ; whereas the spirits of those who are slain in battle are strong and vigorous, their bodies not having been reduced by disease. These ghosts were said to have "leaped into the expanse" (kua rere ki te neneva). This cheerful home of the brave is some1 64 Myths and Songs. times called Tiairi, from the name of the place where Matoetoea, the first man ever slain at Mangaia, is said to have fallen : the idea being " the land which Matoetoea first inhabited," Le. the expanse of heaven. At other times it was termed Popo, or Speck-land; because in the distance of the tipper sky these warrior spirits appear as the veriest specks. The spirits of the slain are immortal. They are clothed with garlands of all sorts of sweet-scented flowers used in mundane dances. The white gardenia, the yellow bua, the golden fruit of the pandanus, and the dark crimson, bell-like blossom of the native laurel are gracefully interwoven with myrtle for this purpose. The employment of these fortunate spirits is to laugh and dance over and over again their old war-dances in remembrance of their achievements in life. In every possible way they enjoy themselves; but look down with ineffable disgust upon those wretches in Avaiki who are compelled to endure the indignity of being covered with dung falling from their more lucky friends above. A well-known and ludicrous proverb refers to the vain flapping of the wings of the unhappy spirits in Avaiki who, besmeared with filth, are endeavouring, though to no purpose, to escape out of Akaanga's net The natural result of this belief was to breed an utter contempt of violent death. Many anecdotes are related of aged warriors, scarcely able to hold the spear, insisting on being led to the battlefield, in hope of gaining a soldier's paradise. One may well exclaim, "Light and immortality were brought to light by the Gospel." i^_ A song lying before me represents the ghosts of certain warriors belonging to the tribe of Tane as "wandering about at Maungaroa Hades ; or, The Doctrine of Spirit-World. 165 and Maputu," the most famous maraes belonging to that family, there to await the period appointed for them to ascend, like the rest, to " Speck-land." In allusion to the myth of the bua tree, a person who has been very ill and yet has recovered will even now playfully say. "Yes, I have set foot upon a branch of the bua tree, and yet have been sent back (by God) to life ! " Those who die a natural death were said " to go to night, or darkness (aere ki te po), implying that they are doomed to be cooked and eaten by Mini, i.e. annihilated. The happier lot of warrior-spirits was "to go to day, or light " (aere ki te ao). Of course, as Christian missionaries, we have not failed to make use of phrases so well adapted to our purpose. The standard expression for " heaven" is "the day, or light of God;" the converse is simply " night, or darkness." On the northern part of this island is a deep indentation in the reef. The rush of waters from the reef meeting the ocean occasions a miniature whirlpool. To account for this simple fact, it was said that a piece of sacred sandstone was once thrown down there : and hence the never ceasing turmoil of waters. In the time of Ngauta, a party of fishermen Karaunu and others dreamt that they were swept away at this ill-omened place. An attacking party overheard the relation of the dream, and made it come true by slaying them all and throwing their bodies into the seething eddy. This unpromising place was regarded as one entrance to the shades, chiefly for the worshippers of Motoro. The destined traveller in his sleep sees a house built on long poles rising above 1 66 Myths and Songs. the restless waters, with a ladder to ascend to it The sides of this house are of closely-fitting yellow reeds, adorned with black cinet Outside this snug, tempting little dwelling are hung new calabashes, etc., etc., to decoy the passer by. Should the spirittraveller pause to admire this illusive hut, he will in all probability feel impelled to climb the ladder and take possession of some of the good things hung all round. The moment his hand is on the exquisitely braided yellow cinet, by which the calabashes are suspended, to his horror, house, ladder, visitor, and calabashes are all swept away into the depths of the ocean, and the doomed spirit finds himself in the unwelcome spirit-world, and in the power of Mini. There are said to be three such " houses of Motoro," or invisible soul-traps to catch unwary spirits. This is but a variation of the doctrine of the bua tree, to meet the circumstances of those who have the ill-luck to be sucked down by the three miniature whirlpools existing here. Since the introduction of Christianity the belief has sprung up that " Avaiki," from which the first inhabitants of this island came, is "Savai'i," the largest island in the Samoan Group. In the Hervey dialect the S is dropped, and the break between the two z's filled up with k. At the Penrhyns the natives speak of " going to Savaikz" when referring to death. Dropping the S, we have the usual form " Avaiki." In the Tahitian islands the Stakes the place of S, and the word becomes "Hawai'i," there being no K in the Tahitian dialect Thus Avaiki, Hawai'i, and Savai'i are slightly varying forms of the same word. Savai'i lying west, or as these islanders say, "down, 93 it would be strictly correct to assert that their ancestors " came up " from Savai'i Hades; or, The Doctrine of Spirit-World. 167 This view of the origin of all these eastern islanders is conformed by the continual recurrence of the names of western islands in the ancient songs and traditions of the natives. In addition to the names of all the near islands of the Hervey and Tahitian Groups, we have "Manuka," i.e. Manu'a, "Tutuila," " #2upolu," for " Upolu," of the Samoan Group. " The distant land of Vavau " is referred to in song ; also Rewa. Tonga continually recurs. A double canoe of " Tongans-sailing-through-the skies 1 " landing on the south of Mangaia, founded the warlike Tongan tribe, now almost extinct. It is well known that that adventurous race once held possession of Savai'i and conquered Niue. Places on Mangaia are called Niue, Rotuma, and Papua. These are ancient appellations indicating, as it seems to me, the course of the original settlers. The reader will recall the names of Savage Island, Rotumah, and the vast island of New Guinea. It has been suggested that the northern Avaiki (Hawaii) was the original home of the islanders. A careful study of their mythology produces an irresistible conviction that Savai'i, the original Avaiki, is the true centre from which this race emigrated, willingly or unwillingly, some five or six centuries ago. How their ancestors got to Samoa remains to be discovered j but the ordinary trade winds north of the equator would make that easy, even if they did not step from island to island, starting from the Malayan peninsula, ever pursued by the savage Negrito races. The son of the elder of three brothers from Avaiki was named " Papa-rangi " literally, the sky-beater. This is the very name by which all foreigners are designated at Samoa at this day. It was evidently in commemoration of. the first settlers having "burst through the sky," in order to get to Mangaia. 1 68 Myths and Songs. Mokiro's son was named " Vaerua-rangi " = Spirit-of-the-sky. " Te-akataaira," the name of the third brother from Avaiki, signifies arrived. Thus' the very names of the three royal brothers from Avaiki signify voyagers from the sun-setting. It suited the purpose of the priests of the dominant tribe in after times, to assert that Avaiki is the hollow of the vast cocoa-nut shell, over the aperture of which Mangaia is placed. In later times it came to be believed that all these distant islands were situate in nether-land. Their ancestors came from " Avaiki ; " and the spirits of those who died a natural death went to "Avaiki," i.e. to the homes of their ancestors. That " Avaiki " and " Po " are interchangeable is clear from the name of a gloomy rent in the rocks at Ivirua, known as " Avaiki-te-po," that is, Avaiki^ or night. The old proverb "Na Avaiki e &&%&" =*Avatkt will revenge it, means " the gods whose home is in Avaiki, particularly Rongo, will revenge it." Sometimes it is said of depth, "deep as Avaiki ;" and figuratively of craft or knowledge, " so and so is Avaiki," i.e. rivals the depth of Hades in wisdom, etc. In every instance unknown depth is implied. " Araara i Avaiki "=think of Avaiki, as being about to die. The Samoan J heaven was designated Pulotu or Purotu, and was supposed to be under the sea. In these eastern islands the same word means " the perfection of beauty." May not this be an adaptation from the former ? At Samoa only figs die, men by a euphemism " finish." The spirits of the dead are said "to go on a journey." Of great men it is asserted that " they have gone to a meeting of chiefs," i.e. 1 Compare Dr. Turner's Nineteen Years in Polynesia, pp. 235-7. Hades ; or, The Doctrine of Spirit-World. 169 in the invisible world. In relation to the death of such, " the heavens are said to be opened," "the clouds have rolled away," Le. to admit the spirits of these grandees. At Rarotonga the grand rendezvous of ghosts was at Tuoro, facing the setting sun. Those from Avarua travelled the ordinary road towards this rocky point of departure for the invisible world. Until very recently, near the sandy beach of Nikao, in sight of the inevitable Tuoro, stood a stately tree known as " the weeping laurel" (te puka aueanga), where disembodied spirits halted awhile to bewail their hard fate. If unpitied and not sent back to life, the enfeebled and disconsolate traveller passed on to the rendezvous and climbed on a branch of an ancient bua still flourishing. Underneath is a natural circular hollow in the rock where Muru spreads his net. Should the branch of this bua break off through the weight of the ghost, the victim is instantly caught in the net. Occasionally, however, a lively ghost would tear the meshes and escape for a while, passing on by a resistless inward impulse towards the outer edge of the reef, in the hope of traversing the ocean. But in a straight line from the shore is a second round hollow, where Akaangds net is concealed. In this the very few who escape out of the hands of Muru are caught without fail. Escape is impossible. The delighted demons (taae) take the captive ghosts out of their nets, dash their brains out upon the sharp coral, and carry off in triumph their victims to the shades to eat Ghosts from Ngatangiia ascended the noble mountain range which extends across the island from east to west, dipping into the sea at Tuoro. Inexpressibly weary and sad was this journey over a road inaccessible to mortals. For this tribe at the rendezvous 170 Myths and Songs. of ghosts was appointed a large iron-wood tree, some of whose branches were green, some dead. The spirits that trod on the green branches came back to life ; whilst those who had the misfortune to crawl on the dead branches were at once caught in the net of either Muru or Akaanga. Warrior spirits were more fortunate, and were said to " aere kia Tiki," that is to join Tiki, the first who so died. At Mangaia Tiki is a woman, sister to Vetini, the first who died a natural death. Tiki sits at the threshold of a very long house with reed sides, in Avaiki, i.e. the shades. All around are planted shrubs and flowers of undying fragrance and beauty. This guardian of the Rarotongan Paradise is ever patiently awaiting new arrivals from the upper world. It was customary at Rarotonga to bury with the dead the head and kidneys of a hog, a split cocoa-nut, and a root of "kava" (piper mythisticum), to enable the spirit-traveller to make an acceptable offering to Tiki, who thus propitiated, admits the giver inside his dwelling. Here, sitting at their ease, eating, drinking, dancing, or sleeping, are assembled the brave of past ages, ready to welcome the new comer, and to relate over again the story of their sanguinary achievements performed in life. The luckless ghost who had no present for Tiki was compelled to stay outside in rain and darkness for ever, shivering of cold and hunger. At Titikaveka, near the sea, is a mass of blood-red stone. It was believed that there is in the sky an oven for cooking human spirits ; the blood of these victims dropping down on the rock gives it a deep red colour i At Aitutaki it was usual to place at the pit of the stomach of the corpse the kernel of a cocoa-nut and a piece of sugar-cane. At Mangaia the extremity of a cocoa-nut frond served the same Hades; or, The Doctrine of SpiritWorld. 171 purpose, as a charm or safe-conduct on entering the invisible world. The sacred men of Pukapuka, or Danger Island, gave me in 1862 two " ere vaerua, " /.. snares for catching souls, made of stout cinet One snare is 28 feet long, the other about half that length. The loops are arranged on either side, and are of different sizes to suit the dimensions of ghosts ; some being thin, others stout. When a person was very sick, or had given offence to the sacred men, the priests hung up some of these " soul-traps " in the upper branches of trees near the dwelling, and pretended to watch the flight of the spirit. If the spirit of the sick man, in the shape of an insect or a small bird, did not enter the snare, the patient recovered ; but if, as the sacred men averred, the wretched ghost became entangled in one of the meshes, there was no hope. The demon " Vaerua," or " Spirit " presiding over spirit-world, hurried off the unlucky ghost to the shades to feast upon, for ceremonial offences. The spirits of those who escape the anger of Vaerua follow the track of the setting sun, and find themselves in a spacious house owned by Reva. Inside are a number of mats, on each of which a divinity keeps watch over the souls belonging to him. These disembodied spirits amuse themselves with beating gongs, dances, and devouring the essence of offerings of food hung up in the marae by relatives in the upper world. A fierce sea-god keeps ceaseless watch all round this house, in case any of the landgods inside should pity one of these forlorn ghosts and allow it to escape back to its old earthly tenement. At Uea, one of the Loyalty Islands, it was the custom formerly when a person was very ill to send for a man whose employment 172 Myths and Songs. it was " to restore souls to forsaken bodies." The soul-doctor would at once collect his friends and assistants, to the number of twenty men and as many women, and start off to the place where the family of the sick man was accustomed to bury their dead. Upon arriving there, the soul-doctor and his male companions commenced playing the nasal flutes with which they had come provided, in order to entice back the spirit to its old tenement . The women assisted by a low whistling, supposed to be irresistibly attractive to exile spirits. After a time the entire procession proceeded towards the dwelling of the sick person, flutes playing and the women whistling all the time, leading back the truant spirit I To prevent its possible escape, with their palms open, they seemingly drove it along with gentle violence and coaxing. On approaching the village they danced and shouted, " We have brought back the spirit of so and so ! " Then would succeed loud laughter and vociferations of delight at the cleverness of their leader, the spiritdoctor. On entering the dwelling of the patient the vagrant spirit was ordered in loud tones at once to enter the body of the sick man, who, as might be supposed, would not be a little moved by the entire procedure. A good feasting would be provided by the relatives of the invalid. Sometimes the poor fellow died : the cause assigned by the soul-doctor would be that the spirit had refused to re-inhabit its former dwelling on account of the smallness of the feast AITUTAKIAN HELL. The priests asserted that at death human spirits descend to the domains of the goddess Mini, whose body is frightfully deformed and her countenance terrible. For unknown ages she had feasted Hades] or, The Doctrine of Spirit-World. 173 on the spirits of the dead, but at length was checkmated by a brave man named Tekauae, J or the-chin. Being apparently near death, he directed his friends, as soon as the breath was out of his body, to get a cocoa-nut, and cautiously cracking it to disengage the round kernel from the shell. This kernel was wrapped up in a piece of cloth and placed next to the stomach of the dead, being completely concealed by the grave coverings. In due time Tekauae descended to spirit-world, and was greatly shocked at the dreadful aspect of the mistress of those regions. Miru had but one &reastthe other had somehow been cut off. Only one leg was perfect the other had been amputated at the knee. But one arm was complete the other had been cut off at the elbow. The deformed hag commanded Tekauae to draw near. The trembling human spirit obeyed, and sat down before Miru. According to her unvarying practice she set for her intended victim a bowl of food, and bade him eat it quite up. Miru with evident anxiety waited to see him swallow it. . As Tekauae took up the bowl, to his horror he found it to consist of living centipedes. The quick-witted mortal now recollected the cocoa-nut kernel at the pit of his stomach, and hidden from Mini's view by his clothes. With one hand he held the bowl to his lips, as if about to swallow its contents with the other he secretly held the cocoa-nut kernel, and ate it the bawl concealing the nut from Miru. It was evident to the goddess that Tekauae was actually swallowing something; what else could it be but the contents of the fatal bowl ? Tekauae craftily contrived whilst eating the nourishing cocoa-nut to allow the live centipedes to fall on the ground one or two at a time. As the intended i Mangaian " te kauvae " = chin. 174 Myths and Songs. victim was all the time sitting on the ground, it was no difficult achievement in this way to empty the bowl completely by the time he had finished the cocoa-nut. Mini waited in vain to see her intended victim writhing in agony and raging with thirst. Her practice on such occasions was to direct the tortured victim-spirit to dive in a lake close by, to seek relief. None that dived in that water ever came up alive j excessive anguish and quenchless thirst so distracting their thoughts that they were invariably drowned. Mini would afterwards cook and eat her victims at leisure. Here was a new event in her history : the bowl of living centipedes had been disposed of, and yet Tekauae manifested no sign of pain, no intention to leap into the cooling but fatal waters. Long did Mini wait ; but in vain. At last she said to her visitor, " Return to the upper world " (i.e. to life). c< Only remember this do not speak against me to mortals. Reveal not my ugly form and my mode of treating my visitors. Should you be so foolish as to do so, you will certainly at some future time come back to my domains, and I will see to it that you do not escape my vengeance a second time." Tekauae accordingly left the shades, and came back to life. His friends, delighted at his recovery, inquired where his spirit had been, and how it had fared. He heeded not the anger of Mini and the promise of secrecy made to her, but informed the inhabitants of this upper world what they might expect should they unfortunately fall into the clutches of this foe to mankind. Hades; or, The Doctrine of Spirit-World. 175 AITUTAKIAN HEAVEN. There is, also, a good land, Iva, under the guardianship of Tukaitaua? a being of pleasing and benevolent aspect, as well as of a gentle disposition. In Iva there is abundance of good food : the finest sugar-cane grows there. The fortunate spirits who get to this pleasant land spend their time in the society of Tukaitaua, chewing with unalloyed appetite this sweet sugar-cane. Tekauae warned the people of this world to be on their guard against Mini. The way to avoid her is to have a cocoa-nut kernel and a piece of sugar-cane placed close to the stomach at death in order to deceive Miru. Departing spirits thus provided go to the pleasant land of Iva, and lying at their ease, evermore feast on the richest food and chew sugar-cane.
