The search for radio emission from the exoplanetary systems 55 Cancri, \uc0\u965  Andromedae, and \u964  Bo\'f6tis using LOFAR beam-formed observations\
\
\
Context. The detection of radio emissions from exoplanets will open up a vibrant new research field. Observing planetary auroral radio emission is the most promising method to detect exoplanetary magnetic fields, the knowledge of which will provide valuable insights into the planet\'92s interior structure, atmospheric escape, and habitability.\
\
Aims. We present LOFAR (LOw-Frequency ARray) Low Band Antenna (LBA: 10\'9690 MHz) circularly polarized beamformed observations of the exoplanetary systems 55 Cancri, \uc0\u965  Andromedae, and \u964  Bo\'f6tis. All three systems are predicted to be good candidates to search for exoplanetary radio emission.\
\
Methods. We applied the BOREALIS pipeline that we have developed to mitigate radio frequency interference and searched for both slowly varying and bursty radio emission. Our pipeline has previously been quantitatively benchmarked on attenuated Jupiter radio emission.\
\
Results. We tentatively detect circularly polarized bursty emission from the \uc0\u964  Bo\'f6tis system in the range 14\'9621 MHz with a flux density of ~890 mJy and with a statistical significance of ~3\u963 . For this detection, we do not see any signal in the OFF-beams, and we do not find any potential causes which might cause false positives. We also tentatively detect slowly variable circularly polarized emission from \u964  Bo\'f6tis in the range 21\'9630 MHz with a flux density of ~400 mJy and with a statistical significance of >8\u963 . The slow emission is structured in the time-frequency plane and shows an excess in the ON-beam with respect to the two simultaneous OFF-beams. While the bursty emission seems rather robust, close examination casts some doubts on the reality of the slowly varying signal. We discuss in detail all the arguments for and against an actual detection, and derive methodological tests that will also apply to future searches. Furthermore, a ~2\u963  marginal signal is found from the \u965  Andromedae system in one observation of bursty emission in the range 14\'9638 MHz and no signal is detected from the 55 Cancri system, on which we placed a 3\u963  upper limit of 73 mJy for the flux density at the time of the observation.\
\
Conclusions. Assuming the detected signals are real, we discuss their potential origin. Their source probably is the \uc0\u964  Bo\'f6tis planetary system, and a possible explanation is radio emission from the exoplanet \u964  Bo\'f6tis b via the cyclotron maser mechanism. Assuming a planetary origin, we derived limits for the planetary polar surface magnetic field strength, finding values compatible with theoretical predictions. Further observations with LOFAR-LBA and other low-frequency telescopes, such as NenuFAR or UTR-2, are required to confirm this possible first detection of an exoplanetary radio signal.\

1 Introduction\
The direct detection of exoplanetary magnetic fields has been elusive despite decades of searching. All the planets in our Solar System, except Venus, have or used to have a magnetic field (Stevenson 2003), and theoretical scaling laws predict that many exoplanets might have one as well (e.g., S\'e1nchez-Lavega 2004; Grie\'dfmeier et al. 2007a; Christensen et al. 2009). Measuring the magnetic field of an exoplanet will give valuable information to constrain its interior structure (composition and thermal state), its atmospheric escape, and the nature of any star-planet interaction (Hess & Zarka 2011; Zarka et al. 2015; Grie\'dfmeier 2015, 2017; Lazio et al. 2016, 2019; Lazio 2018; Griessmeier 2018; Zarka 2018). Historically, some of the first constraints on the interior structure of the Solar System gas giants came from the knowledge that they had magnetic fields (Hubbard & Smoluchowski 1973). Magnetic drag caused by an exoplanet\'92s magnetic field on its atmosphere (e.g., Perna et al. 2010; Rauscher & Menou 2013; Rogers & Komacek 2014) could be an important factor for the atmosphere\'92s dynamics and evolution, and it could contribute to the anomalously large radii of hot Jupiters (Laughlin 2018). Additionally, the magnetic field of Earth-like exoplanets might contribute to their sustained habitability by deflecting energetic stellar wind particles and cosmic rays (e.g., Grie\'dfmeier et al. 2005a, 2009, 2015, 2016; Lammer et al. 2009; Kasting 2010; Owen & Adams 2014; Lazio et al. 2010a, 2016; McIntyre et al. 2019).\
\
Many methods have been proposed to study the magnetic fields of exoplanets. A full description of all available methods (excluding the recent method described by Oklop\uc0\u269 i\u263  et al. 2020 using spectropolarimetric transits of the helium line) can be found in Grie\'dfmeier (2015). The methods most extensively discussed in the literature are observations of radio emission (Farrell et al. 1999; Zarka et al. 2001; Zarka 2007), optical signatures of star-planet interactions (SPI; Cuntz et al. 2000; Shkolnik et al. 2003, 2005, 2008; Cauley et al. 2019), and near-ultraviolet light curve asymmetries (Vidotto et al. 2010a, 2011; Llama et al. 2011). The latter two methods have many astrophysical scenarios that can create false-positives (e.g., Preusse et al. 2006; Lai et al. 2010; Kopp et al. 2011; Miller et al. 2012, 2015; Bisikalo et al. 2013; Saur et al. 2013; Alexander et al. 2016; Kislyakova et al. 2016; Turner et al. 2016a; Gurumath et al. 2018; Route 2019). By contrast, radio observation can constrain the magnetic field amplitude directly, without invoking complex model assumptions, and is less susceptible to false positives (Grie\'dfmeier 2015). In this paper, we focus on the detection of exoplanetary magnetic fields via radio emission.\
\
All the magnetized planets and moons in our Solar System emit or induce radio emissions via the Cyclotron Maser Instability (CMI) mechanism (Wu & Lee 1979; Zarka 1998; Treumann 2006). The first proof and measurement of Jupiter\'92s magnetic field, the first measured magnetic field of a planet other than Earth, came from observing its decametric radio emission (Burke & Franklin 1955). Planetary CMI radio emission is caused by electrons accelerated to energies of several keV by the interaction of the stellar wind or coronal mass ejections with the magnetosphere or by acceleration processes inside the magnetosphere, resulting from magnetosphere-ionosphere or magnetosphere-satellite coupling (Cowley et al. 2003; Grie\'dfmeier et al. 2007b; Zarka 2007, 2018; Grie\'dfmeier 2017). CMI emission is highly circularly polarized, beamed, and time-variable (e.g., Zarka 1998; Zarka et al. 2004). It is produced at the local electron cyclotron frequency (or gyrofrequency) in the source region; its spectrum sharply drops off at a maximum gyrofrequency \uc0\u957 g, which is determined by the maximum magnetic field Bp near the planetary surface, as \u957 g[MHz] = 2.8 \'d7 Bp[G] (Farrell et al. 1999). This sharp drop-off can also be seen, such as, in Fig. 1.\
\
Recent reviews by Zarka et al. (2015) and Grie\'dfmeier (2015, 2017) summarize the observational campaigns and theoretical work concerning radio emission from exoplanets. Following several seminal works (Winglee et al. 1986; Zarka et al. 1997, 2001; Farrell et al. 1999; Zarka 2007), an extensive body of theoretical work has been published (e.g., de Pater 2000; Farrell et al. 2004; Lazio et al. 2004; Stevens 2005; Grie\'dfmeier et al. 2005b, 2007b,a; Jardine & Collier Cameron 2008; Vidotto et al. 2010b, 2012, 2015; Hess & Zarka 2011; Nichols 2011, 2012; See et al. 2015; Nichols & Milan 2016; Fujii et al. 2016; Weber et al. 2017a,b, 2018; Lynch et al. 2018; Zarka 2018; Wang & Loeb 2019; Kavanagh et al. 2019; Shiohira et al. 2020).\
\
One of the goals of these theoretical studies is to predict the radio flux and frequency of emission as observed from Earth. However, these predictions are hardly more than educated guesses, with associated uncertainties estimated as one order of magnitude for the flux density and a factor of 2\'963 for the maximum emission frequency (Grie\'dfmeier et al. 2007a). For example, different rotational-independent and rotational-dependent scaling laws have been employed to predict exoplanetary magnetic-field strengths (e.g., S\'e1nchez-Lavega 2004; Grie\'dfmeier et al. 2007a; Christensen et al. 2009; Reiners & Christensen 2010; Grie\'dfmeier 2017 \'96 see Christensen 2010 for an overview of all scaling laws in the literature). Similarly, the Radiometric Bode\'92s law, successfully used to predict the radio fluxes from Uranus and Neptune (Desch & Kaiser 1984; Warwick et al. 1986, 1989; Desch 1988; Million & Goertz 1988), is often used to estimate the intensity of emission from exoplanets (e.g., Farrell et al. 1999; Lazio et al. 2004), especially in its Radio\'96Magnetic version (Zarka 2007, 2018; Grie\'dfmeier et al. 2007a; Zarka et al. 2018). In particular, using a rotational-dependent scaling law Grie\'dfmeier (2017) finds 15 exoplanets with flux densities potentially above the theoretical detection limit Turner et al. (2017a) derived for the beamformed mode of the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR; van Haarlem et al. 2013).\
\
In parallel to these theoretical studies, a number of ground-based observations have been conducted to find radio emission from exoplanets, most of which have resulted in clear non-detections (Yantis et al. 1977; Winglee et al. 1986; Zarka et al. 1997; Bastian et al. 2000; Farrell et al. 2003; Ryabov et al. 2004; Shiratori et al. 2006; George & Stevens 2007; Lazio & Farrell 2007; Smith et al. 2009; Lecavelier Des Etangs et al. 2009, 2011; Lazio et al. 2010a,b; Stroe et al. 2012; Hallinan et al. 2013; Murphy et al. 2015; Lynch et al. 2017, 2018; Turner et al. 2017a; O\'92Gorman et al. 2018; Lenc et al. 2018; Green & Madhusudhan 2021; Narang et al. 2021; de Gasperin et al. 2020). Most of these studies have involved imaging observations and only span a small fraction of the planetary orbit. A number of possible reasons could account for the non-detections (see, e.g., Bastian et al. 2000; Hallinan et al. 2013; Zarka et al. 2015; Grie\'dfmeier 2015, 2017): (1) the observations were not sensitive enough, (2) the planetary magnetic field is not strong enough for emission at the observed frequencies, (3) the Earth was outside the beaming pattern of the radio emission at the time of the observations (Hess & Zarka 2011), and (4) CMI quenching due to the plasma frequency of the planet\'92s ionosphere being greater than the cyclotron frequency (Grie\'dfmeier et al. 2007a; Weber et al. 2017a,b, 2018; Lamy et al. 2018).\
\
There have been a few tentative detections (Lecavelier des Etangs et al. 2013; Sirothia et al. 2014; Vasylieva 2015; Bastian et al. 2018) but none of these have been confirmed by follow-up observations. The recent detection of 8\'9612 GHz emission from SIMP0136 is the first radio signal of an object near the brown dwarf and planetary boundary (12.7 \'b1 1.0 MJup; Saumon & Marley 2008) and opens up the possibility of detecting free-floating planets (Kao et al. 2016, 2018). Additionally, V830\uc0\u964  is the first non-degenerate exoplanet host-star detected to emit radio emission (Bower et al. 2016) and continued radio monitoring of the system may allow for the detection of star-planet interactions (see Loh et al. 2017, and in prep.). Recent LOFAR observations from the LoTSS survey (Shimwell et al. 2017, 2019) revealed low-frequency radio emission from the M-dwarfGJ 1151 in the range 120\'96167 MHz, suggested to be caused by the interaction with a close-in Earth-size planet (Vedantham et al. 2020; Pope et al. 2020; Foster et al. 2020).\
\
In this study, we analyze LOFAR Low Band Antenna (LBA) beamformed observations for three exoplanetary systems (55 Cancri, \uc0\u965  Andromedae and \u964  Bo\'f6tis). Our data are the first beamformed observations of exoplanets performed with LOFAR. This work extends the preliminary analysis of the LOFAR observation of 55 Cnc published in Turner et al. (2017a).\
\
In this paper, Sect. 2 gives relevant information on the three planetary systems we observed. Sections 3 and 4 describe the observations and data processing, respectively. The analysis of individual observations can be found in Sect. 5. The implications of our tentative detections are discussed in Sect. 6. Section 7 contains conclusions and suggestions for future steps. Extensive supporting material is presented in the appendices.\

For Jupiter, the radio flux increases during periods of high activity (frequently by one order of magnitude, and exceptionally by two orders of magnitude, see e.g. Zarka et al. 2004; Zarka 2004); the same variability is assumed for exoplanetary emission, as indicated by the vertical black arrows. Dashed lines and triangles (light blue) show the theoretical sensitivity limit of the radio-telescopes UTR-2, LOFAR (low band), VLA, LOFAR (high band), and GMRT (for 1 h of integration time and a bandwidth of 4 MHz, or an equivalent combination). Numbered lines and points (green): sensitivity achieved in previous observations of \u964  Bo\'f6tis. Care must be taken when comparing the theoretical sensitivity limit to previous observations. The sensitivity limits of the radio telescopes as well as most upper limits were calculated for continuous emission, whereas the values for observations2 and 9 take into account the expected \'93bursty\'94 nature of the emission.

2 Target selection\
In this study, we analyze LOFAR-LBA beamformed observations of the planetary systems 55 Cancri, \uc0\u965  Andromedae, and \u964  Bo\'f6tis. Based on their proximity to the Solar System, the stellar age, the estimated planetary mass, and the small orbital distance of the planet, these systems were predicted to be good candidates to search for radio emission (Grie\'dfmeier et al. 2007a; Grie\'dfmeier 2017). All three systems are also considered prime candidates for the search for star-planet interactions (Shkolnik et al. 2005, 2008; Folsom et al. 2020).\
\
The relevant parameters of the planets and their host stars are summarised in Table 1. The values for the expected emission frequency and the expected radio flux are taken from Grie\'dfmeier (2017), the data of which are also available electronically at CDS1. We estimate the uncertainties of \uc0\u957 max to be factor 2\'963 and the uncertainties on \u934 max to be approximately one order of magnitude (Grie\'dfmeier et al. 2007a). For the magnetic field estimate (required for the calculation of both \u957 max and \u934 max), we have explored two different models. In model NR, the planetary rotation does not have any influence on the planetary magnetic field. In model R, the planetary rotation has an influence on the planetary magnetic field (via tidal locking of the planet with its parent star). Details are given in Grie\'dfmeier (2017).\
\
An observation campaign makes sense if the expected emission frequency is above the terrestrial ionospheric cutoff (~10 MHz) and if the expected flux density is higher than the telecope sensitivity. Turner et al. (2019, hereafter T19) estimate that the sensitivity of LOFAR is ~50 mJy for circularly polarized flux (Stokes V) in integrations of 2 min and 10 MHz. In the following, we compare these numbers to the expected values for the three observed systems.\
\
55 Cancri (55 Cnc)\
The G8V star 55 Cancri A hosts one of the first known exoplanets; today, five planets are known in this system, andmore are expected to exist. The star has a visual binary companion of spectral type M4.5V, \uc0\u961 1 Cnc B, with a projected distance of 1100 AU. The two stars are expected to be gravitationally bound (Fischer 2018). For this system, two planets are interesting with respect to radio emission, namely 55 Cnc b and 55 Cnc e. If the planetary magnetic field does strongly depend on planetary rotation (model R), the emission of 55 Cnc b is below the ionospheric cutoff, but not the emission from 55 Cnc e. If the planetary magnetic field does not strongly depend on planetary rotation (model NR), both planets have emission above the ionospheric cutoff. The expected flux density for 55 Cnc b is low, but the estimate for 55 Cnc e is above the LOFAR detection threshold. As an added benefit, the orbital period of 55 Cnc e (0.74 days) can be easily covered with a few observations. Good orbital coverage is important if emission is only active for certain orbital phases, which is expected. Also, 55 Cnc e is a transiting planet; in the case of detected radio emission, secondary transits are a good way to check a planetary origin of the radio emission. In the case of a detection, flares from the host star (55 Cnc A) and its binary companion (55 Cnc B) will have to be ruled out as potential causes.\
\
Table 1 Stellar and planetary parameters for the exoplanets observed in this study.\
\uc0\u965  Andromedae (\u965  And)\
\uc0\u965  Andromedae A is a F9V star with a stellar binary companion, Andromedae B, at a projected distance of ~700 AU from the primary star. The binary companion \u965  Andromedae B is of spectral type M4.5V and has been detected in X-rays (Poppenhaeger & Wolk 2014). For model R, the estimated emission frequency is below the ionospheric cutoff, but in model NR, the expected planetary radio emission extends to detectable frequencies. The expected flux density is above the LOFAR detection threshold. Flares from the host star and its binary companion will have to be ruled out as potential causes in the case of a detection.\
\
\uc0\u964  Bo\'f6tis (\u964  Boo)\
\uc0\u964  Bo\'f6tis A is a hot and young F7V star. Its binary companion \u964  Bo\'f6tis B is of spectral type M3V; it is on a highly eccentric orbit (e = 0.87) with a semimajor axis of ~220 AU (Justesen & Albrecht 2019). For model R, the expected planetary radio emission only slightly exceeds the ionospheric cutoff limit. Nominally, the flux exceeds the detection threshold, but the estimate of 50 mJy does not take into account the reduced sensitivity of LOFAR at 15 MHz. However, for model NR the emission extends to detectable frequencies, and the expected flux density is above the detection threshold. As for the two other systems, flares from the host star and its binary companion will have to be ruled out as potential causes in the case of a detection.\
\
Figure 1 compares the predicted radio flux for \uc0\u964  Boo b to the sensitivity achieved in previous observations. This figure makes the motivation behind our observationstangible: radio fluxes predicted by at least some of the models are compatible with the theoretical sensitivity limits of several radio-telescopes. In particular, according to the model NR, radio emission from \u964  Boo b should be detectable by UTR-2 and LOFAR (low band), and possibly by the VLA.\
\
3 Observations\
Our observations were taken with the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR; van Haarlem et al. 2013), using its Low Band Antenna (LBA, 10\'9690 MHz) in beamformed mode (Stappers et al. 2011). The setup used for our observations can be found in Table 2. The exact dates and times of each observation can be found in Appendix A (Table A.1), which also gives the coordinates used for the ON and OFF beams (Table A.2).\
\
The data streams from all 24 core stations were summed together during the observations. All the processing steps described in this paper are performed on this summed data product. This means it is not possible to flag out the contribution of any of these stations a posteriori if any station does not operate optimally, the stations were phased up to produce multiple simultaneous digital beams within the broader individual station beams: one pointing at the target, and two pointing at different OFF sky positions (used for comparison in the data processing pipeline, see below).\
\
We focus on the Stokes-V data. T19 have shown that this allows one to detect signal that are 1 to 1.5 orders of magnitude weaker than when using Stokes-I data (provided that the signal is circularly polarized, which is expected here). The observations were taken at high temporal and spectral resolutions (\uc0\u964  and b) in order to allow proper RFI mitigation.\
\
As in our previous studies (Turner et al. 2017a, 2019), we compare our on-target beam (\'93ON-beam\'94) to several simultaneous beams pointing to a nearby location in the sky (\'93OFF-beam 1\'94 and \'93OFF-beam 2\'94). A fundamental assumption of this methodis that the OFF beams provide a good characterization of the ionospheric fluctuations, RFI, and any systematics present in the ON-beam. For that purpose, the OFF beams are well within the station beams (10\'b0 FWHM at 30 MHz), far enough from the ON-beam to not overlap within the beam diameter (13.8\uc0\u8242  at 30 MHz), and also close enough to the ON-beam to be within the ionospheric isoplanatic patch (7\'b0 at 30 MHz; Intema et al. 2009 and C. Vogt, priv. comm.).\
\
For this project, 22 exoplanet observations were taken with a total of 89 h, plus 16 observations of B0809+74 totaling 197 min. The observations were all obtained during night-time to avoid contamination by strong RFI. During the observing period May 19\'96November 22, 2016 the LBA calibration tables were unreadable, resulting in 20% higher noise (communication from ASTRON Radio Observatory staff). Both the 55 Cnc and \uc0\u965  And data are affected by this calibration error.\
\
For geometrical reasons, we expect the emission to be beamed at Earth only for a fraction of the time (e.g., Hess & Zarka 2011). Assuming the anisotropic beaming is similar to that of Jupiter (Zarka et al. 2004), we would expect the emission to be visible from Earth only ~10% of the time. Also, the intensity of the radio emission is expected to vary as the planet encounters different plasma conditions (particle density, magnetic field) along the orbit (e.g., Grie\'dfmeier et al. 2005b, 2007b; Fares et al. 2009; Vidotto et al. 2012). For these reasons, the observation windows were chosen such that the orbital coverage is as wide as possible in order to maximize the chances to detect beamed emission. The orbital coverage of our observations is shown in Fig. 2. For the observations of 55 Cnc (with a total observing time of 24 h), the observation windows can be folded at the orbital period of either 55 Cnc b (Fig. 2a) or 55 Cnc e (Fig. 2b). For the short-period transiting planet 55 Cnc e, the full orbit is covered more than once, increasing the chances of catching beamed emission. Also, secondary eclipses constitute a powerful tool: If radio emission is detected, but vanishes during the secondary eclipse, this can be taken as a very strong indication for a planetary origin of the radio emission (e.g., Grie\'dfmeier et al. 2005b; Smith et al. 2009; Lecavelier des Etangs et al. 2013) For 55 Cnc b, the orbital period is longer, and the phase coverage is low (9%). For \uc0\u965  And (Fig. 2c), the phase coverage is 40% with a total observing time of 45h. Finally, for \u964  Boo (Fig. 2d), the phase coverage is 25% of the orbit with a total observing time of 20h; we cannot exclude that we have missed radio emission concentrated at specific orbital phases.\

4 Data pipeline\
Based on previous work (Vasylieva 2015; Turner et al. 2017a, 2019), we have developed the BeamfOrmed Radio Emission AnaLysIS (BOREALIS) pipeline for our exoplanetary beam-formed data. It was applied to the both Stokes-I and Stokes-V data-sets of the observations presented in Sect. 3.\
\
This pipeline performs RFI mitigation, empirically determines the time-frequency (t-f) response of the telescope (i.e. the gain), normalizes the data by this t-f function, and rebins the data into larger time and frequency bins. The RFI mitigation combines four different techniques (Offringa et al. 2010, 2012; Offringa 2012; Zakharenko et al. 2013; Vasylieva 2015; and references therein) for optimal efficiency and processing time, following which the data is normalized and rebinned to time\'96frequency bins of 1 s \'d7 45 kHz. The expected thermal noise level for the rebinned data is 6 Jy for each measurement. The resulting corrected Stokes-V dynamic spectrum (, defined in Eqs. (9)\'96(11) of Sect. 4.2.1 in T19) is the input for the post-processing part of the BOREALIS pipeline. An example of a processed dynamic spectrum for each target is displayed in Fig. 3. The fine structure seen in Fig. 3 can be caused by ionospheric scintillation on the Galactic background and some small residual instrumental effects. Additionally, the variable patches seen above 40 MHz are likely produced by LOFAR-core\'92s grating lobes. At lower frequencies the grating lobes are below the horizon. The fluctuations in the flux of the OFF-beams are less than 1% which is consistent with the expected thermal noise error of ~0.5%. We note that the dynamic spectra presented throughout this paper are in units of the system equivalent flux density (SEFD) since the data has been normalized by the t-f response function of the telescope. The SEFD include contributions from both the sky and instrument. The SEFD of LOFAR does change slightly with frequency (see van Haarlem et al. 2013). In this paper we use an average value of 40 kJy for the SEFD of a single LOFAR station, that is to say 1.7 kJy for the full LOFAR core (i.e. the sum of 24 LOFAR stations). We use these units to simplify the display and analysis of the dynamic spectra and convert to Jy when necessary.\
\
The post-processing part of the BOREALIS pipeline is based on a series of observable quantities (labeled Q1a, Q1b, Q2, and Q4a-f). These quantities were introduced in T19; they are also recalled in Appendix B. The quantities Q1a and Q1b represent integrated quantities, namely the frequency-integrated time-series (Q1a) and the time-integrated frequency spectrum (Q1b). Both Q1a and Q1b are designed to find slowly variable emission (with time scales of minutes to hours). Q2 represents the high pass filtered frequency-integrated time-series. It can be displayed as a \'93scatter plot\'94 comparing a pair of beams (e.g., the ON and OFF beam) and is designed to find bursty emission (with time scales <~1 min). The quantities Q4a to Q4f provide statistical measures of the bursts identified by the Q2 quantity. When examining Q4a-f, the ON and OFF time series are compared to each other; for this, we introduce the difference curve Q4fDiff = Q4f(ON)-Q4f(OFF). We then plot this curve against a reference curve computed from 10 000 draws of purely Gaussian noise. A more detailed description of each observable can be found in Appendix B, or in T19.\
\
The efficiency of the quantities Q4a to Q4f for the detection of faint bursty emission was compared in T19. This benchmark analysis was based on artificially attenuated radio emission of Jupiter and led to the conclusion that Q4f is the most sensitive observable quantity for faint burst emission. However, exoplanetary radio emission may be different from Jupiter radio emission. Therefore, we examined all the observable quantities in our analysis and not just the most sensitive one indicated by the Jupiter benchmark study (Q4f).\
\
The post-processing is initially performed on the absolute value of the corrected Stokes-V data (). In case of a tentative detection, information on whether the polarization of the emission is right-handed or left-handed is obtained by analysing  and  where,\

The numbers representing each date are indicted in Col. 1 of Table A.1. We note that 55 Cnc e is a transiting exoplanet. For 55 Cnc e, only a few planetary rotations are shown. For 55 Cne e, the entire orbit is covered by the observations, whereas the orbital coverage is low for 55 Cnc b. Approximately 40 and 25% of the orbits of \u965  And b and \u964  Boo b are covered, respectively. The \u964  Boo observations with the tentative detections (Sect. 5.1; obs #1 and #6) are displayed as large dark-blue rectangles in panel d.\

The post-processing was performed separately over 3 different frequency ranges depending on the observational setup and target. A summary of the parameters used in the post-processing can be found in Table 3. While the nominal rebin time was 1 s, we also reanalyzed the dataset with a rebin time of 10 seconds to search for longer and weaker bursts of emission. The RFI mitigation step creates a high-resolution mask (at scales b and \uc0\u964  of Table 2) of flags (0 for polluted pixels, 1 for clean ones). Since the processed dynamic spectrum is rebinned, we also have to rebin the flag mask to the same time and frequency resolution. Consequently, the rebinned flag mask contains fractional values between 0.0 and 1.0. In the post-processing we applied a threshold of 90% on the mask, meaning that that we only retain a bin if \u8805 90% of its constitutive pixels were clean. We note also that the elliptical correction described in T19 and summarised in Appendix B was systematically applied to the analysis of Q2 and Q4 as this correction allows one to detect fainter signals.\
\
The basic assumption of our analysis is that the OFF beams characterize the noise and systematics that affect the ON-beam well enough to search for a faint signal by comparison (ON vs. OFF) or difference (ON-OFF). As Q4 difference curves often show large fluctuations, we found it absolutely necessary to record and analyze two OFF beams simultaneously with the ON beam. The analysis of one observation with a given set of processing parameters includes the statistical comparison of the three different combinationof beams: ON vs. OFF1, ON vs. OFF2, and OFF1 vs. OFF2. We label a signal as a tentative dection only if an excess appears in the former 2 pairs and not in the latter one. If the OFF1 vs. OFF2 analysis shows an excess (with any sign) then asimultaneous tentative signal in ON vs. OFF is considered as a false positive, and discarded. All the conclusions in this paper are the same when comparing the ON-beam to either of the OFF beams (OFF1 or OFF2). For this reason, we simply refer to the \'93ON vs. OFF2\'94 comparison as \'93ON vs. OFF\'94 throughout the rest of the paper.\
\
In total, ~13 000 summary plots were produced, summarizing the analysis of all observations (Table A.1) using the post-processing parameters given in Table 3. We applied the following criteria defined in T19 for a possible detection: (1) one or several Q4 curves show an excess \uc0\u8805 2\u963  statistical significance for the ON-OFF statistics, (2) the same Q4 curves have a shape clearly different from the OFF1-OFF2 curve, and (3) the detection curve remains positive over a large interval of thresholds \u951  > 1.5\u963 . The way these criteria are implemented in an automated search algorithm is described in Appendix C.\

5 Data analysis and results\
For most of the observations and frequency ranges explored we did not find any excess signal in the ON-beam when compared to the OFF beams. The observables Q1a and Q1b do show some structure, but those structures are identical between the ON and OFF beam (examples for Q1b are shown in panels b and d of Fig. D.1). Indeed, for all observations (except for observation L570725 of \uc0\u964  Boo, see Sect. 5.1.2), the curves for the ON and OFF beams are equivalent within 1\u963 . We also tested the presence of red noise in the difference time-series (Q1a) for all our non-detections using the time-averaging method (Pont et al. 2006; Turner et al. 2016b, 2017b), and found none. Thus the majority of the difference in the signal between the two beams can be explained purely by Gaussian white noise. We also searched for burst emission using Q4a-f; for almost all observations, the burst statistics were similar between the ON and OFF beams.\
\
For \uc0\u964  Boo we found one tentative detection of faint burst emission in observation L569131 and one tentative detection of slowly variable emission in observation L570725, as summarised in Table 4. These tentative detections are examined in detail in Sect. 5.1. We also find a marginal signal of faint burst emission for \u965  And in observation L545197, which is explored more in detail in Sect. 5.2.\
\
5.1 \uc0\u964  Bo\'f6tis\
5.1.1 Observation L569131 (2017-02-18)\
For \uc0\u964  Boo, we detect Stokes-V burst emission in the frequency band 15-38 MHz in observation L569131 from the Q4 observables (Fig. 4; Table 4). In particular, Fig. 4 shows an excess of bursts in the ON-beam in Q4f (panel f, curve ON-OFF), whereas both OFF beams show comparable statistics (the curve OFF1-OFF2 is almost flat). The burst emission is also seen in  (defined in Eq. (2)), suggesting that the emission is left-hand polarized.\
\
To isolate the frequency range of the signal, we processed a finer grid of frequency ranges (6 MHz in bandwith) within 15\'9638 MHz. Performing this test, we find that the majority of the signal is from the 15\'9621 MHz range. Therefore, we use this frequency range to tentatively deduce physical information about the planet (see Sect. 6.2.1).\
\
We estimate the flux density of this signal using the sensitivity limit derived in T19. In that work, this limit was found to be equal to 1.3 times the LOFAR theoretical sensitivity (\uc0\u963 LOFAR)2 and consisted of 30 data points above \u951  = 2\u963  in Q4f. The signal in Q4f for observation L569131 consists of 21 data-points (each binned to a resolution of 1 s and 24 MHz) above \u951  = 2\u963  level3. These points result in a Q4fDiff curve above the 2 sigma Gaussian reference curve. The flux in the tentative detection should be near the sensitivity limit since the number of detected points between the Jupiter observation (T19) and the \u964  Boo observation (the present work) are comparable4. Also, the uncertainty is similar to that derived in T19.\
\
The theoretical sensitivity limit of LOFAR for broadband bursts is\
\
\
where N is the number of stations (24), b is the bandwidth (6 MHz), \uc0\u964  is the timing resolution (1 s), and SSys is the station SEFD with a value of 40 kJy (van Haarlem et al. 2013). Using the sensitivity limit of 1.3 \'d7 \u963 LOFAR (T19) and Eq. (4), we find a flux density estimate for the burst emission of 890 mJy. In this, we assumed an uncertainty of a quarter of an order of magnitude (100.25) for the sensitivity limit (see T19). The uncertainties given here are merely rough estimates; the real values depend on the time and frequency scale of the emission.\
\
To quantity the statistical significance of the detected signal we use the method outlined in T19. The difference of the ON-OFF beam in the observable Q4f (Q4fDiff the solid black line in Fig. 4f) is normalized by the 1\uc0\u963  Gaussian statistical limit (the lower-positive dashed-line in Fig. 4f) and we calculate its average value (
\f1 \uc0\u10216 
\f0 Q4fDiff
\f1 \uc0\u10217 
\f0 ). 
\f1 \uc0\u10216 
\f0 Q4fDiff
\f1 \uc0\u10217 
\f0  is then compared to the case when the ON and the OFF beams only contain random noise. Using this procedure, we find that the probability of a false positive for obtaining the ON-beam signal is 7 \'d7 10\uc0\u8722 4, equivalent to a 3.2\u963  detection. Finally, we compare these values to those of the two OFF beams (the solid red line in Fig. 4f). For the OFF beams we find a false positive rateof 19% indicating clearly a non-detection.\
\
To further assess the statistical significance of the detected signal we perform a two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test in which we compare the Q4f ON-OFF and OFF1-OFF2 curves. The null hypothesis is that the two curves are drawn from the same parent distribution. Performing the K-S test we find that the probability to reject the null hypothesis (that the two curves are drawn from the same parent distribution) is high with a value of 98%. This test adds to the evidence that the two curves are distinctly different and that this signal is real.\
\
To summarize this analysis: We detect a bursty signal in this observation. This signal is statistically significant. Its potential origin is discussed in Sect. 6.\
\
Table 4 Summary of detected signals and derived planetary parameters assuming that the emission originates from the planet (see Sect. 6 for a discussion of the arguments for and against a planetary origin for the signals).\
5.1.2 Observation L570725 (2017-03-06)\
For \uc0\u964  Bo\'f6tis, we also detected slowly variable emission in the range 14\'9638 MHz in observation L570725. This emission was detected using the dynamic spectra integrated over frequency (time-series, Q1a) and time (integrated spectrum, Q1b) in Stokes-V (Fig. 5; Table 4). The signal is also an outlier when compared to all N2 numbers for all observations (Fig. C.3). The OFF beams are equivalent within 1\u963  for both Q1a and Q1b suggesting that there is an excess signal in the ON beam. Further examination of Q1b determined that the bulk of the ON-beam emission is coming from the range 21\'9630 MHz. We did not find any short-term (1\'9610 s) burst emission using the observable Q4 for this observation (Fig. E.1). The slow emission feature is seen in  but not in  (not shown), suggesting that the emission \'96 if physical \'96 is right-hand circularly polarized.\
\
The fluxdensity of the signal can be estimated from the ON-OFF beam difference (bottom panels in Figs. 5a,b). We find a mean signal of 1.1 \'b1 0.2 \'d7 10\uc0\u8722 4 of the theoretical SEFD from Q1a. Since all the emission is coming from the range 21\'9630 MHz (Fig. 5b), the calculation of Q1a was limited to this range. We find a value of 190 \'b1 30 mJy for the time-averaged signal. The quoted error above is the standard deviation of the difference of Q1a for the OFF beams. We find a maximum emitted flux of 430 \'b1 30 mJy using the peak spectral flux (~2.5 \'d7 10\u8722 4 of the SEFD) observed in the difference of Q1b. Again, the error is the standard deviation of the difference of Q1b for the OFF beams.\
\
To quantify the statistical significance of this signal, we use a method similar to the technique outlined in T19 and described thoroughly in Appendix F. We find that the probability of a false positive for obtaining a signal like the one we observe is 2.1 \'d7 10\uc0\u8722 12 for the Q1a(ON)-Q1a(OFF2) (bottom panel in Fig. 5a) and 1 \'d7 10\u8722 18 for Q1b(ON)-Q1b(OFF2) (bottom panel in Fig. 5b). This corresponds to a statistically significant signal of 6.9\u963  and 8.6\u963 , respectively. For the OFF-beams we find that the false positive rate is ~ 90% for Q1a(OFF1)-Q1a(OFF2) and ~ 100% for Q1b(OFF1)-Q1b(OFF2), clearly corresponding to a non-detection.\
\
We examine the dynamic spectrum of the ON-beam and OFF-beams to determine the time-frequency structure of the emission in observation L570725. In Fig. 6, we show the dynamic spectrum of the beams ON (panel a), OFF 2 (panel b), ON - OFF 2 (panel c), OFF 1 - OFF 2 (panel d), ON/OFF 2 (panel e), and OFF 1/OFF 2 (panel f). The processed dynamic spectrum (with an original time and frequency resolution of 1 s and 45 kHz, respectively) has been binned to 6 s and a boxcar window 3 pixels across (135 kHz) has been applied along the frequency direction to reduce the noise. The ON-beam signal is clearly seen as structured excess emission in panels a and c. These structured features are very similar to the observed radio dynamic spectrum of Jupiter (e.g., Zarka 1998; Marques et al. 2017). There is no equivalent large scale structure in the OFF beam difference plot (panel d), confirming that these two beams are very similar to each other.\
\
Panel b in Fig. 6 shows that the OFF beams contain a replica of the ON signal. The signal is ~1.6 times fainter in the OFF beam dynamic spectrum when compared to the ON-beam (panel e). We found convincing evidence that the replica signal in the OFF beam originates from the ON beam. Using the pulsar B0809+74 observation L570723 (taken 15 min before observation L570725), we detect the pulsar in the ON-beam but also in the two OFF beams (Fig. G.2). Additionally, we examine the Jupiter observation L568467 (data taken from T19) and find that the ratio of the ON to OFF beam flux is S(ON)
\f2 \uc0\u8725 
\f0 S(OFF) ~ 1.6 (Fig. 7). The flux density ratios (ON/OFF) for the Jupiter observation is consistent with the value found for the \uc0\u964  Boo observations. The replica signal is likely caused by imperfect phasing of LOFAR at the epoch of the observations, which leads to strong side lobes within the station beam (personal communication from M. A. Brentjens, ASTRON).\
\
We explored several non-astronomical sources (e.g., instrumental systematics) for the signal in the ON-beam in observation L570725. First, during each of our observations, 1-2 LOFAR stations did not operate optimally (cf. Table A.1, second-to-last column). Close inspection showed that the ON-beam signal in this observation was not caused by this (see Appendix H for details). Next, if the ON beam signal was a permanent instrumental effect, it should also appear in the observation of the pulsar B0809+74 (observation L570723, preceding the \uc0\u964  Boo observation by 16 min). We find no such large scale features in the range 20\'9630 MHz in that observation (Fig. G.2). This suggests that the ON-beam signal is either real excess flux in that beam or a time-variable instrumental effect. Finally, low-level features in the integrated spectrum (Q1b) are seen for all ON and OFF beams for all targets (Fig. D.1). For each observation except L570725 these features do not change in time and are similar for the ON and OFF beam within the error bars. The ON-beam feature in observation L570725 (Fig. D.1f, orange line) has an amplitude comparable to the features seen in ON and OFF beams in all other \u964  Boo observations (Figs. D.1e,f). However, both OFF-beams in observation L570725 have a lower amplitude, leading to the detection of an excess signal (ON-OFF). The fact that the ON-OFF excess is caused by a lower level in the OFF beam rather than a higher level in the ON-beam casts some doubt about the astrophysical origin of the detected signal. However, the time-frequency structure in the dynamic spectrum of observation L570725 is not the same as for the other observations. The differences between the dynamic spectra (Fig. I.1) show large scale systematics, which suggests a different source for the emission in this observation.\
\
Summarizing the detailed arguments presented above and in the Appendices, we could not identify an instrumental origin or systematic error for the excess ON-beam signal detected in observation L570725. The amplitudes of ON and OFF signal on that day compared to the other dates encourage us to skepticism, but the time-frequency structure of the signal leaves some room for an astrophysical origin. In all cases, follow-up observations with several radio telescopes are necessary to confirm or invalidate this potential signal.\

In all panels the ON-beam shows an excess above 2 \u963  statistical significance and is distinctly different from the OFF-beams. The probability to obtain the OFF beam curve in Q4f (panel f) by chance is ~81%, whereas it is 7 \'d7 10\u8722 4 for the ON-beam curve, corresponding to a 3.2\u963  detection. A Kolmogorov\'96Smirnov statistical test on the two curves for Q4f in panel f conclude that the probability to reject the null hypothesis (that the two curves are drawn from the same parent distribution) is 98%.\

Panel a: the ON-beam shows excess signal above both OFF beams at all times. Panel b: the signal inthe ON-beam is concentrated between 21 and 30 MHz and is distinctly different than in both OFF-beams. In both panels, the two OFF beams are equivalent within the error bars, calculated assuming pure Gaussian noise (). The dynamic spectrum for this signal can be found in Fig. 6. We find by performing Gaussian simulations that the probability to randomly reproduce the signal in the ON-beam curve in Q1a is 2.1 \'d7 10\u8722 12 and 1 \'d7 10\u8722 18 for Q1b. This probability corresponds to a statistically significant detection of 6.9\u963  and 8.6\u963 , respectively.\

5.2 \uc0\u965  Andromedae\
For \uc0\u965  And, we detected burst emission in the frequency band 14\'9638 MHz in observation L545197 (2016-09-08) using the Q4f observable (Fig. J.1). The Q4f signal consists of 8 data-points greater than \u951  = 2\u963  and a Q4fDiff curve above the 2 sigma Gaussian reference curve (Fig. J.1c).\
\
Similar to Sect. 5.1.1, we find an approximate emission flux of 1.3 \'d7 \uc0\u963 LOFAR(1+0.20) ~ 540 mJy using Eq. (4) and taking into account the 20% extra noise mentioned in Sect. 3. The probability that the ON\u8722 OFF Q4f curve is a false positive is 1.3% (assuming Gaussian statistics), equivalent to a 2.2\u963  detection. By contrast, the probability of obtaining the OFF1\u8722 OFF2 curve by chance is 41%. Additionally, we used the K-S statistical test to assess whether the ON-OFF and OFF1-OFF Q4f curves in Fig. J.1f could have been drawn from the same distribution. We find that the probability to reject the null hypothesis (that the two curves are drawn from the same parent distribution) is marginal with a value of 76%. The signal we find for \u965  And is not highly statistically significant, so the possibility for a false-positive is high. Observations (L545197) also marginally stands out when compared to other observations (detection criterion N6, Fig. C.3). In rare cases (1%), OFF-beams reach comparable or higher values, adding to the uncertainty on the detection. We present this marginal detection for reference in hope to facilitate and guide future observations of this system.\

The ON-beam signal is clearly seen as structured excess emission in panels a, c, and e. A faint signal is seen in the OFF beams (e.g., panel c) likely due to ionospheric refraction of the ON-beam signal (also see Appendix G). However, there is no visible excess difference when the two OFF-beams are subtracted by each other (panel d) suggesting that whatever is causing the faint OFF-beam signal is the same for both beams.\

6 Discussion\
6.1 Origin of the detected signals\
We first examine arguments for and against a celestial origin of the signals in the \uc0\u964  Boo observations (Sect. 6.1.1 for observations L569131, Sect. 6.1.2 for observation L570725). Then, assuming that the bursty emission (L569131) and the slowly varying signal (L570725) are of celestial nature, we explore in greater detail whether those signals could originate from the \u964  Boo system (Sect. 6.1.3) and from the exoplanet \u964  Boo b itself (Sect. 6.1.4).\
\
6.1.1 Arguments on whether the detected signal in observation L569131 is of a celestial origin\
The arguments for a celestial origin of the bursty signal in observation L569131 of \uc0\u964  Boo (i.e. it not being an instrumental effect or RFI) are the following:\
\
1. We find a signal in Q4f equivalent to a 3.2\uc0\u963  detection (Fig. 4). The ON-OFF difference (black curve) is distinctly different from the OFF1-OFF2 difference (red curve red). The K-S test finds that the probability to reject the null hypothesis (that the two curves are drawn from the same parent distribution) is 98%.\
\
2. The signal is circularly polarized, as expected for CMI emission.\
\
3. There is no evidence for low-level residual RFI. Indeed, residual RFI would cause flux to appear simultaneously in the ON- and OFF-beams, and would be seen as points with high values close to the main diagonal in the Q2 plot (Fig. 4a). Also, the main diagonal is excluded in the calculation of the Q4f observable quantity.\
\
An argument against a celestial origin is:\
\
1. There is a possibility that low-level RFI could cause the signal in the event that the RFI conditions between the ON and OFF beams are significantly different. However, there is no evidence that the RFI is different between the beams. Also, wehave demonstrated that the RFI mitigation step in the pipeline is efficient (Turner et al. 2017a, 2019).\
Since we do not find potential false positives for the bursty signal, this is likely a real detection of celestial emission and not an instrumental effect. However, a detection at 3.2\uc0\u963  level is not highly significant and calls for confirmation via follow-up observations.\
\
6.1.2 Arguments on whether the detected signal in observation L570725 is of a celestial origin\
Likewise, wenow summarize the arguments for and against the possibility that the slowly varying signal in observation L570725 of \uc0\u964  Boo is indeed real celestial emission. The arguments for a real detection are:\
\
1. There is a clear signal in Q1a equivalent to 6.9\uc0\u963  and Q1b equivalent to 8.5\u963  (Fig. 5).\
\
2. The signal is found to be circularly polarized, as expected for CMI emission.\
\
3. The signal has a complex structure in time-frequency (Fig. 6) reminiscent of Jupiter radio arcs (e.g., Marques et al. 2017).\
\
4. The structures seen in the dynamic spectra of the ON-beam are distinctly different than all OFF-beams for every \uc0\u964  Boo observation (Fig. I.1).\
\
5. All observations in this study were processed identically with the BOREALIS pipeline (Vasylieva 2015; Turner et al. 2017a; T19). The L570725 signal is the only one among many observations and runs with similar observing conditions (Table A.1).\
\
6. All OFF-beams in each individual observation are consistent with each other within expected Gaussian error bars (Fig. D.1). There is no indication that any of the beams (ON or OFF) in any observation has abnormal behavior.\
\
7. All ON and OFF beams in each individual observation except L570725 are also consistent with each other assuming Gaussian error bars (Fig. D.1).\
\
8. The RFI mitigation in the pipeline is efficient (Turner et al. 2017a, 2019) and there is no evidence that RFI remains in the data. Also, the signal does not look like RFI.\
\
9. The ON and OFF beams are close enough to each other (Table A.2; 2-3\'b0) so that the ionospheric fluctuations should be quite similar in all three beams.\
\
The arguments against a celestial signal and potential explanations are as follows:\
\
1. In observation L570725, the two OFF-beams contain weak replicas of the ON beam signal (Fig. 6). We believe this replica signal can be explained by imperfect phasing of the LOFAR core. This assessment is based on the analysis of observations of Jupiter (Fig. 7) and the pulsar B0809+74 (Fig. G.1), taken in the same mode as our exoplanet observations.\
\
2. During each of our observations, 1-2 LOFAR stations did not operate optimally and showed some spurious behaviour in the frequency range 21\'9630 MHz (Fig. H.1). A quantitative analysis suggests that this is not the origin of the apparent signal (Fig. H.1).\
\
3. The ON-beam excess in observation L570725 is caused by an unusually low signal in both OFF-beams rather than an unusually high high signal in the ON-beam. Indeed, the ON-beam feature at 21\'9630 MHz has an amplitude comparable to the features seen in ON and OFF beams in all other \uc0\u964  Boo observations (Fig. D.1e). However, the structure in the dynamic spectrum of the observation L570725 is not the same as in all other observations, especially those with large-scale systematics (Fig. I.1). It is unclear why observation L570725 is different from our other \u964  Boo observations. We cannot rule out a small temporary variation within the telescope.\
\
We do have some doubt about the slowly varying signal. Further observations may show whether such a signal is confirmed; if not, it may have been caused by an instrumental artifact.\
\
6.1.3 Arguments for the detected signals originating from the \uc0\u964  Boo system\
Assuming the bursty and slowly variable signal are real and of celestial origin, do these signals originate from the \uc0\u964  Boo system? Or could other possible radio sources be at the origin of the detected circularly polarized signals?\
\
In general, most astrophysical radio sources display little circular polarization. There is only one known object detected in Stokes-I at 150 MHz in the TGSS survey (Intema et al. 2017) within the 13.8 arcmin \uc0\u964  Boo ON-beam of the LOFAR core. This same object is also detected in the 1.4 GHz VLA FIRST Survey Catalog (Helfand et al. 2015). This object is probably a background radio-loud quasar since it produces emission over a large frequency range. This quasar is likely not the origin of our detected signals since quasars generally have a small degree of circular polarization (< 2%, e.g., Bower et al. 2002). During all our observations, simultaneous observations of Jupiter between 10 and 40 MHz were taken using the Nan\'e7ay Decameter Array (NDA; Boischot et al. 1980; Lamy et al. 2017). No emission was seen during the time period of the observation L570725. Therefore, it is very unlikely that the ON-beam signal is caused by Jupiter decameter emission in a side lobe. Radio signals from artificial satellites are also sometimes polarized. However, the detected signals are not from a low Earth orbit (LEO) spacecraft because a LEO satellite would pass from horizon to horizon in several minutes; in our data, the detected signals are visible for much longer timescales. It is also unlikely that the signal is a geostationary (GEO) spacecraft since all three beams are close together on the sky and the same beams were used for all observations of each planet (cf. Table A.2). Besides, the time-frequency structure of the signal does not resemble a satellite beacon. As we do not see any other compelling explanation, we conclude it is indeed likely that the source of the detected signals is located within the \u964  Boo system.\
\
6.1.4 Arguments for the detected signals originating from the exoplanet \uc0\u964  Boo b\
Several physical arguments suggest that the detected signals originate from the planet \uc0\u964  Boo b rather than its host star. The planetary emission is expected to be much stronger than the stellar emission for hot Jupiters (e.g., Grie\'dfmeier et al. 2005b; Zarka et al. 1997; Zarka 2011). Grie\'dfmeier et al. (2005b) estimated that the radio emission from the planet \u964  Boo b would be stronger by several orders of magnitude than the galactic background, the quiet and quiescent stellar emission, and stellar noise storms. While stellar radio bursts can in principle be as intense as the planetary emission, there is no evidence that \u964  Boo undergoes large flare events; no such flares have been seen in two years of long-term monitoring of the system with the MOST satellite (Walker et al. 2008) and X-ray observations from XMM-Newton (Mittag et al. 2017).\
\
The Radio\'96Magnetic Bode\'92s law (Zarka et al. 2001, 2018; Zarka 2007, 2018; Grie\'dfmeier et al. 2007a) predicts that for close-in planets an emission flux up to 106\uc0\u8722 7 times Jupiter\'92s radio flux should be possible. Zarka (2010) tested this scaling law by examining the radio emission from magnetized binary stars. They found that the radio emission (likely not due to CMI) from the RS CVn stellar system V711 Tauri matched approximately the extrapolation of the law derived for the Solar System (Mottez & Zarka 2014). Their result suggests that the radio\'96Magnetic Bode\'92s law could hold for 10 orders of magnitude above the range of solar system planets. The recent detection of Ganymede-induced radio emission confirms the Radio\'96Magnetic Bode\'92s law (Zarka et al. 2018). Several models suggest that there could be deviations of one order of magnitude from this scaling law (Nichols 2011; Saur et al. 2013; Nichols & Milan 2016), but the deviation remains modest compared to the large-scale tendency.\
\
Stellar and planetary radio emissions are also expected to have different polarization properties (Zarka 1998; Grie\'dfmeier et al. 2005b). The detected signal is circularly polarized, which is expected for planetary CMI emission. Quiet and quiescent stellar radio emission usually have a low polarization degree (quiescent emission of M dwarfs has occasionally been observed to reach a polarization degree of 50%, G\'fcdel 2002, and references therein). Stellar radio bursts can be circularly polarized if they are caused by the CMI. However, there is no previous evidence of radio flares from the \uc0\u964  Boo system. More importantly, a star needs to be strongly magnetized (Bstar >10\'96100 G) to produce CMI emission that is not quenched by the coronal plasma (Zarka 2007). For \u964  Boo, the mean stellarmagnetic field has been measured to be 1.7\'963.9 G (Catala et al. 2007; Donati et al. 2008; Fares et al. 2009, 2013; Mengel et al. 2016; Jeffers et al. 2018). CMI emission from the star over the frequency range of the detected signals is thus unlikely. Still, since the surface magnetic field maps (e.g., Vidotto et al. 2012) do not cover small-scale magnetic structures (Mittag et al. 2017), CMI emission from small active regions cannot be not ruled out. Also, the magnetic field of the M-dwarf companion star \u964  Boo B is unknown. For this reason, stellar flares cannot be ruled out and could potentially be the cause for the detected radio signal.\
\
CMI emission from the planet \uc0\u964  Boo b remains a possible cause for the detected circularly polarized radio signal. It it not the only possible source, the other being radio emission by stellar flares. A major argument in favor of planetary radio emission would be the detection of a radio signal compatible with the planetary rotation period. Follow-up observations are required to confirm the presence of this faint signal, and subsequently verify its origin.\
\
6.2 Physical constraints on the planetary systems\
6.2.1 \uc0\u964  Bo\'f6tis\
Assuming that at least one of the two detections (L569131 and L570725) is real and due to CMI emission from the planet (Table 4), we can constrain the maximum surface magnetic field of the planet \uc0\u964  Boo b to be in the range ~5\'9611 G. CMI emission is produced at the local gyrofrequency, \u957 g(MHz) = 2.8 \'d7 Bp(G), and we use the full frequency range of the detected signals (15\'9630 MHz) to constrain the magnetic field range for \u964  Boo b. This value is slightly smaller than Jupiter\'92s maximum surface polar magnetic field of 14 G (Acuna & Ness 1976; Connerney 1993). The magnetic moment () of the planet that can be expressed as:\
\
(5)\
\
where Bp and BJup are the exoplanet\'92s and Jupiter\'92s polar magnetic field strength, and Rp and RJup are the radius of the planet and Jupiter. Rp is estimated to 1.06 RJup using a parametric equation for the radius of an irradiated planet (Wang & Ford 2011). We find a magnetic moment  of 0.94  for \uc0\u964  Boo b. Our tentative \u964  Boo detections are labeled as observation 9 in Fig. 1. The figure shows that the magnetic field and emission strengths derived for \u964  Boo b are consistent with the predictions by Grie\'dfmeier et al. (2007a) and Grie\'dfmeier (2017) (in particular with the NR model). Our derived magnetic field strengths could place constraints on the dynamo theory. The field strength estimated for the planet should allow for a sustained planetary magnetosphere, thus protecting it from the stellar wind (Nicholson et al. 2016). The detection of radio emission from \u964  Boo b is also interesting in view of atmospheric simulations. For a typical hot Jupiter, CMI quenching by a high plasma frequency in the planetary ionosphere can potentially prevent radio emission; for \u964  Boo b, however, this problem is alleviated by the high planetary mass and thus low electron density in the ionosphere (Weber et al. 2017a,b, 2018).\
\
We can estimate the power and brightness temperature of the observed emission in both detections (L569131 and L570725). The power of the polarized emission can be estimated by:\
\
(6)\
\
where S is the observed polarized flux density, \uc0\u937  is the solid angle filled by the CMI emission beam (assumed to be in the range 0.16\'961.6 sr similar to Jupiter\'92s decameter emission; Zarka et al. 2004), d is the distance to the planet (15.6 pc for \u964  Boo b), and \u916 \u957  is the frequency range (Col. 3 of Table 4). Using Eq. (6) and the maximum observed flux, we find a power of 6.3 \'d7 1014\'962.0 \'d7 1016 W for \u964  Boo b (Table 4). This derivedpower is 104\u8722 5 greater than Jupiter\'92s maximum decametric emission (4.5 \'d7 1011 W; Zarka et al. 2004). The derived power is consistent with theoretical predictions (Grie\'dfmeier et al. 2007a, Grie\'dfmeier 2017) and compatible with our tests on LOFAR beam-formed data (T19) which showed that such a large power is needed to be detectable from ~15 pc distance. The brightness temperature (TB) of the radio source is:\
\
(7)\
\
where \uc0\u969  is the angular size of the emission source, k is the Boltzmann constant, and \u955  is the wavelength. With the power of the exoplanetary radio emission being much higher than that of Jupiter, Eq. (7) means that either the brightness temperature of the emission from \u964  Boo b is much higher than that of Jupiter, or the source region is much more extended. A source size of 1 RJup implies a brightness temperature of 4.2 \'d7 1017 to 2.0 \'d7 1018 K (Table 4), similar to the brightness temperature of Jovian radio bursts (2 \'d7 1017 K; Zarka 1992), but the latter is reached in sources of size 10\'96100 km only (Zarka et al. 1996). These flux densities require a very high Poynting flux due to the proximity of the planet to the star, following the radio magnetic scaling law (e.g., Zarka et al. 2001, 2018; Grie\'dfmeier et al. 2007a). Once the planetary origin of the signal is established, modeling of the dynamic spectrum with a software like ExPRES (Hess & Zarka 2011; Louis et al. 2019) will provide more information about the emission source and magnetic field structure.\
\
6.2.2 \uc0\u965  Andromedae\
The only radio signal tentatively seen from the \uc0\u965  And system is at 2.2\u963  level in observation L54519. If this marginal detection is real, the flux from the system is 540 mJy. If it is a false-positive, we can derive a 3\u963  upper limit of 124 mJy from the range 26\'9673 MHz using the Q1a observable for slowly varying emission. For the moment, we classify this as a non-detection, implying that either the observations were not sensitive enough, the planetary magnetic field is too weak to emit at the observed frequencies, or that Earth was outside the beaming pattern of the radio emission at the time the observationswere carried out.\
\
6.2.3 55 Cancri\
We can estimate an upper limit on the radio emission from our non-detection of the 55 Cnc system. We find a 3\uc0\u963  upper limit of 73 mJy from the range 26\'9673 MHz using the Q1a observable for slowly varying emission. Using the attenuated Jupiter modeling done in T19, this is equivalent to a flux density less than 105 times the peak flux of Jupiter\'92s decametric burst emission (~5 \'d7 106 Jy; Zarka et al. 2004). Due to our full orbital coverage of 55 Cnc e, we can rule out beaming effects (Earth outside the beaming pattern) as the cause of our non-detection. Therefore, our non-detection of 55 Cnc implies that either the planetary magnetic field is too weak to emit at the observed frequencies or that the emission is too weak.\
\
6.3 Limitations of beamformed observations\
Beamformed observations provide very good resolution in time and frequency (in the present study, we used 10 ms and 3 kHz). They are extremely powerful for studying strong (e.g., Jupiter; Marques et al. 2017, the Sun; Pick & Vilmer 2008), periodic (e.g., pulsars; Pilia et al. 2016), or dispersed bursts (e.g., RRATs; Karako-Argaman et al. 2015, FRBs; CHIME/FRB Collaboration 2019), as well as spectral lines (e.g., RRLs; Asgekar et al. 2013). The situation is much less favorable for weak non-periodic broadband bursts without a clear dispersion signature such as radio bursts expected from exoplanets (e.g., Zarka et al. 1997). This emission is the most difficult kind of emission to detect at low-frequencies in beamformed mode.\
\
Imaging observations excel at detecting continuous and moderately bursty signals. Progress in sky imaging at low-frequencies has been huge recently (e.g., LoTSS, Shimwell et al. 2019). For low-frequency radio telescopes like LOFAR-LBA (van Haarlem et al. 2013) and NenuFAR (Zarka et al. 2012, 2020) imaging is still difficult, computationally expensive, limited by RFI and ionospheric effects, and sometimes impossible due to the lack of good calibrators, thus beamformed observations are still relevant. There has been recent development of a software package called DynSpecMS5 (Tasse et al., in prep.) that produces low resolution (~8 s \'d7 ~10 kHz in LoTSS) dynamic spectra from the calibrated visibilities of imaging data. DynSpecMS will provide as many OFF-beams as image pixels, and thus may be a good alternative to beamformed observations when high-quality imaging is possible (e.g., LOFAR-HBA).\
\
Beamformed observations retain several advantages over imaging data. They have higher time resolution (in our case 10 msec, compared toseveral seconds), which can be used to mitigate RFI on shorter time scales, although not on individual station level. Beamformed observations also excel at the detection of short bursty signals. The computational cost of their processing is significantly less than for imaging observations since only a handful of pixels have to be analyzed. As done in this paper, a typical observation in beamformed mode should involve 1 ON-beam and 2 to 3 simultaneous OFF-beams (e.g. Zarka et al. 1997; Turner et al. 2017a).\
\
However, beamformed observations also suffer from several drawbacks. Any spurious emission in the side lobes or from instrumental origin is difficult to distinguish from real emission. Having several simultaneous OFF beams is absolutely crucial in that case. We found that two OFF beams are a critical minimum to be able to compare statistics as done in this paper. Future observationsmay need to have more OFF beams (3 or 4 surrounding the target), even at the expense of the frequency bandwidth (or increasing the data volume in the case of the LOFAR core), to better evaluate the background and side lobe effects. Also, if a variable strong low-frequency source is in the sky (e.g., Jupiter or the Sun), it should be monitored (e.g., with a dedicated beam) in order to identify any emission that it could contribute to the ON-beam.\
\
It is currently not possible to conclude whether the imaging or beamformed approach is better adapted for the study of exoplanetary radio emission. As long as this question is unanswered, both types of observations should be pursued. In the ideal case, observations should be executed in both modes simultaneously whenever possible. This paper has demonstrated that beamformedobservations can provide important information; as a consequence, they will certainly continue to play a useful role in studying exoplanetary radio emission.\
\
7 Conclusions\
In this study, we obtained and analyzed LOFAR-LBA beamformed circularly polarized (Stokes-V) observations of the exoplanetary systems 55 Cancri, \uc0\u965  Andromedae, and \u964  Bo\'f6tis. For the \u964  Boo system, we tentatively detect circularly polarized burst emission in the range 14\'9621 MHz with a statistical significance of 3.2\u963  (Table 4; Fig. 4). We cannot rule out stellar flares as the source of the emission and emission from the planet \u964  Boo remains a possible cause (see Sect. 6.1.4); follow-up observations are required (see next Section). For \u964  Boo, we also detect slowly variable emission in the range 21-30 MHz with a significance of 8.6\u963  (Table 4; Fig. 5). A thorough analysis did not allow any firm conclusion: the existence of this signal can neither be confirmed with certainty, nor can it fully be refuted (Sect. 6.1.2). Our observations of the 55 Cnc system cover twice the full orbit of the inner planet (Fig. 2b). This is the first time an exoplanetary radio search project has full orbital coverage of an exoplanetary target. No emission is seen from 55 Cnc and we placed a 3\u963  upper limit of 73 mJy on the system from our observations. For the \u965  And system, we found burst emission in the range 14\'9638 MHz with a marginal statistical significance of 2.2\u963 . We classify this as a non-detection. For \u964  Boo b and \u965  And b the phase coverage is 25% (Fig. 2c) and 40% (Fig. 2d), respectively. For this reason, we cannot rule out that we have missed radio emission concentrated at specific orbital phases not covered. Using the \u964  Boo detections (L569131 and L570725) from the range 15\'9630 MHz and assuming the emission is from the planet and generated by the CMI mechanism (Sect. 6), we derived a maximum surface polar magnetic field for \u964  Boo b between ~5-11 G. The signals for \u964  Boo b range from 190 to 890 mJy with an emitted power of 6.3 \'d7 1014\'962.0 \'d7 1016 W and a brightness temperature of 0.42\'962.0 \'d7 1018 K (Table 4). The magnetic field and emission strengths derived for \u964  Boo b are consistent with the predictions (Table 1; Fig. 1) by Grie\'dfmeier et al. (2007a) and Grie\'dfmeier (2017).\
\
Follow-up low-frequency radio observations (e.g., LOFAR, UTR-2, LWA-OLWA, NenuFAR) are needed to confirm our tentative detections from \uc0\u964  Boo and the marginal detection from \u965  And. Searching for periodicity in the detected signals will be crucial in confirming their origin and nature. Simultaneous observations between twofacilities (e.g LOFAR and NenuFAR) is highly encouraged to rule out possible false-positives due to instrumental effects. We also hope to incorporate machine learning techniques (e.g., Baron 2019) into BOREALIS in the future to more efficiently search through the post-processing outputs. Ancillary data on these targets are also critical. The planetary mass and planetary inclination are well constrained from high-resolution spectroscopy observations (Brogi et al. 2012; Rodler et al. 2012; Piskorz et al. 2017). The planetary rotation period couldalso be constrained using high-resolution data (e.g., Brogi et al. 2016). Continued or simultaneous monitoring of stellar lightcurves for stellar flares can be done with the northern version of Evryscope that is currently undergoing commission (Law et al. 2015; Ratzloff et al. 2019; Howard et al. 2019). X-ray monitoring is also useful as an indicator to discriminate the planetary signal from that of the star. Follow-up and if possible simultaneous stellar magnetic field maps (e.g., obtained by Zeeman-Doppler Imaging) and wind measurements (e.g., astrospheric absorption) would also be extremely beneficial for the interpretation of future observations.\
\
Beamformed observations are notoriously difficult to exploit for exoplanetary radio emission. Despite these drawbacks, they can provide useful information, as demonstrated in this paper. We expect them to continue to play an important role in the future alongside other observing modes such as imaging observations.\

Appendix A Observational setup\
Table A.1 gives the exact dates, times and observation IDs for each one of our observations. It also includes the number of stations that were found to behave non-optimally during the observation, and the an assessment of the data quality (percentage of data masked during RFI flagging).\
\
Table A.1 shows that we observed the pulsar B0809+74 for 10 or 15 min either before or after each of the \uc0\u965  And and \u964  Boo observations. For these observations, we used the same settings as the exoplanet observation. These pulsar observations were taken to test and calibrate the processing pipeline. Some of these tests are shown in Appendix G.\
\
Table A.1 Summary of the observations.\
Table A.2 Beam coordinates used for the observations.\
For all observations, the beam coordinates of the ON and OFF beams are given in Table A.2. For the observations of 55 Cnc, the positions of the two OFF beams correspond to the position of the pulsar B0823+26 (OFF beam 1) and at a nearby \'93empty\'94 sky region (OFF beam 2). For the \uc0\u965  And and \u964  Boo observations, the two OFF beams correspond to \'93empty\'94 sky patches, i.e. positions without point sources at a level \u8805  100 mJy according to the LOFAR MSSS-HBA survey (150 MHz, Heald et al. 2015) and without point sources at \u8805  5 mJy in the TGSS survey (150 MHz, Intema et al. 2017).\
\
Appendix B Observable quantities\
The post-processing section of the BOREALIS pipeline computes a series of observable quantities, Q1 to Q4. As defined in T19, Q1 is designed to search for slowly variable emission on the order of minutes to hours. Q2 is the frequency-integrated time-series designed to find bursty emission and is created by integrating the processed data over a selected frequency range (several trial values were used, see Table 3), followed by high-pass filtering using a smoothing window of 10 time bins (e.g 10 s for a rebin time of 1 s) and normalization by the standard deviation. Q3 is designed to localize the bursts (Q2) in time with a resolution \uc0\u948 T (e.g., 2 min) for one selected threshold \u951  (in units of standard deviations). Q4 is the statistical analysis of the broadband burst emission (Q2), searched over an entire observation and a selected frequency range, and plotted against the threshold \u951 .\
\
For convenience, the definition of those each observable quantities that are used in the present work is summarised below:\
\
Q1: slowly variable emission observables.\
\
Q1a (Time-series): dynamic spectrum integrated over all frequencies and rebinned to a time resolution of \uc0\u948 T (e.g., 2 min)\
\
Q1b (Integrated spectrum): dynamic spectrum integrated over all times and rebinned to a frequency resolution of \uc0\u948 F (e.g., 0.5MHz)\
\
Q2 : time series obtained by integrating the processed data over a selected frequency range (several trial values were used, see Table 3), followed by high-pass filtering created using a smoothing window of 10 time bins (e.g., 10 s for a rebin time of 1 s) and normalization by the standard deviation.\
\
Q4: statistical analysis of the broadband burst emission (Q2), searched over an entire observation and a selected frequency range, and plotted against the threshold \uc0\u951  (in units of standard deviations).\
\
Q4a (Number of Peaks): number of peaks where Q2 \uc0\u8805  \u951 .\
\
Q4b (Power of Peaks): sum of the power of peaks where Q2 \uc0\u8805  \u951 .\
\
Q4c (Peak Asymmetry): number of peaks where Q2 \uc0\u8805  \u951  subtracted by the number of peaks where Q2 \u8804  \u8722 \u951 .\
\
Q4d (Power Asymmetry): sum of the power of peaks where Q2 \uc0\u8805  \u951  subtracted by the sum of the |power| of peaks where Q2 \u8804  \u8722 \u951 .\
\
Q4e (Peak Offset): number of peaks where Q2 \uc0\u8805  \u951  for the ON-beam and exceeding the corresponding OFF values by a factor \u8805 2.\
\
Q4f (Power Offset): sum of the power of peaks where Q2 \uc0\u8805  \u951  for the ON-beam and exceeding the corresponding OFF values by a factor \u8805 2.\
\
When examining Q4a-f, we compare two beam against each other in the form of difference curves, e.g. Q4fDiff= Q4f(ON)-Q4f(OFF) or Q4fDiff=Q4f(OFF1)-Q4f(OFF2).\
\
The post-processing pipeline produces Q1-Q4 synthesis plots, for each observation of Table A.1, pair of beams, and set of parameters of Table 3. Example Q1, Q2, and Q4 plots can be found in Figs. 4 and 5. Figure 5 shows the Q1 observables (Q1a in Fig. 5a and Q1b in Fig. 5b). The ON beam is displayed in black, and the OFF-beams are displayed in red and blue. The lower panel show the differences between two beams (orange, green, and brown curves). Figures 4a and b display the observable quantity Q2 in the form of scatter plots. These scatter plots allow to compare two beams by showing the normalized signal in one beam versus the normalized signal in the other. Figures 4c\'96f display the Q4a, Q4b, Q4e, and Q4f observables for the ON-OFF and OFF1-OFF2 difference curves. In these plots, the 3 pairs of dashed curves surrounding the horizontal axis indicate the \'b1 1, \'b12 and \'b13\uc0\u963  levels reached when computing these Q4 observables from 10 000 pairs of Gaussian noise time series, as a function of the threshold on normalized signal intensity. Q4 difference curves exceeding the 2\u963  to 3\u963  reference curves over a significant range of thresholds indicate a possible detection. We consider the observables Q4a-f separately.\
\
In most observations, the distribution of points in the Q2 scatter plot is not as \'93circular\'94 as it should be if both signals were Gaussian. Ionospheric fluctuations affecting both the ON- and the OFF-beam simultaneously may elongate thescatter-plot along the main diagonal and thus cause cause a non-circular distribution. To remedy this problem, an elliptical correction was designed (T19). It circularizes the distribution of points in the Q2 scatter plot (i.e. mitigates the ionospheric fluctuations), thus allowing to detect more easily outliers which appear only in the ON-beam.\
\
Appendix C Detection criteria\
At the end of Sect. 4, we showed the criteria that are used to determine a tentative detection. These criteria are based on the observable quantities (Q1a, Q1b, Q2, and Q4a-f, as defined in Appendix B). In this appendix, we describe how these criteria are implemented in an automated search algorithm.\
\
C.1 Criteria for slowly varying emission (observable quantities Q1a and Q1b)\
For the observables Q1a and Q1b, we define the following detection criteria (sometimes also called \'93summary numbers\'94):\
\
N1: integral of the ON-OFF difference curve.\
\
N2: percentage of positive values in the ON-OFF difference curve.\
\
N3: standard deviation of the ON-OFF difference curve.\
\
N4: probability of false-detection, comprised between 0 and 1. It describes the likelihood that the ON-OFF difference curve can be reproduced from simulations based on random Gaussian noise. For example, a probability of 6.3 \'d7 10\uc0\u8722 5 corresponds to a 4\u963  detection.\
\
The detection criteria N1 to N3 should increase if there is an excess signal in the ON-beam.\
\
C.2 Criteria for burst emission (observable quantities Q4a to Q4f)\
For the observables Q4a to Q4f, we define the following detection criteria:\
\
N5: integral of the ON-OFF difference curve.\
\
N6: ratio of N5 to the integral of the 1\uc0\u963  reference Gaussian curve (e.g., dashed lines in Fig. C.2). The reference curve was created by running simulations on 10 000 pairs of Gaussian noise distributions and calculating the respective observable (i.e. Q4f).\
\
N7: percentage of positive values in the ON-OFF difference curve.\
\
N8: percentage of ON-OFF values above the 1\uc0\u963  reference Gaussian curve.\
\
N9: minimum (\uc0\u951 min) and maximum (\u951 max) threshold values where ON-OFF > 0.\
\
N10: percentage of positive values in the ON-OFF difference curve for \uc0\u951 min \u8804  \u951  \u8804  \u951 max\
\
N11: percentage of negative values in the ON-OFF difference curve for \uc0\u951  \u8805  \u951 max\
\
N12: probability of false-detection, comprised between 0 and 1 (similar to N4).\
\
If an excess signal is in the ON-beam then the detection criteria N5 and N6 should both be greater than 0. The detection criteria N5, N6, and N10 probe the continue nature of the emission which is essential for a detection. Additionally, N11 can be used to eliminate false-positives because N11 = 0 for a detection.\
\
C.3 Test of the detection criteria\
In order to determine the reliability of the detection criteria in finding a signal, we tested them on LOFAR data containing radio emission from Jupiter. We used the LOFAR dataset of Jupiter radio emission attenuated by a factor \uc0\u945  =10\u8722 3 from T19. An example Q1a difference curve can be seen in Fig. C.1 and the corresponding detection criteria from these plots are listed in Table C.1. All the Q1 detection criteria show an excess in the ON-beam. The excess is moderate because the emission essentially consisted of two burst, one near the beginning and one ear the end of the interval (see Fig. 1 in Turner et al. 2019). From N4, we conclude this is a real detection at 3.8\u963  significance.\

Table C.1 Values of detection criteria for Q1a from Fig. C.1.\
An example Q4f difference plot is shown in Fig. C.2; the corresponding detection criteria are listed in Table C.2. We note that the line in the plot for \uc0\u951 max and \u951 min are slightly offset due to the granularity of the simulations in \u951 -space. In Table C.2, all detection criteria show an excess in the ON-beam with very large ratios for N5 and N6. N6 also probes the continuous nature of the curve which is essential for detection. N12 is also very useful because it allows us to check the false positive rate of any tentative detections. From these detection criteria. we conclude a firm detection of bursty emission in this dataset.\

\
Open with DEXTER\
C.4 Numerical implementation\
Based on these results, we can define a set of parameters for an automatic search algorithm. The parameter for the automated search for detections in Q1a and Q1b was N2 > 80%, indicating that the ON-beam should contain more slowly variable emission than the OFF beam for most of the observation. For Q4f, N6 appears to be the most sensitive criterion for bursty signals since its ratio between the ON-OFF and OFF1-OFF2 curves is the highest. Also, N6 probes the continuous nature of the Q4 difference curve, which is essential for a detection. Therefore, we required for automatic burst detection for Q4f that N6(ON-OFF) > 1 and N6(ON-OFF) > N6(OFF1-OFF2). Finally, the criterion N12 is also very useful because it allows us to check the false positive rate of any tentative detection.\
\
C.5 Comparison of detection criteria for different post-processing runs\
We can plot all post-processing runs (each run is referred to as a run number) together to look for outliers and locate observations or processing runs that require a more detailed inspection. A run number is defined by a specific target (e.g., \uc0\u964  Boo), date and observation (e.g., L569131), frequency range (e.g., 15\'9638 MHz), polarization (e.g., |V |), and rebin time (\u948 \u964 , 1 s or 10 s). An example of this can be found in Fig. C.3, which shows, as a function of observation number, (a) the detection criteria N2 calculated for the observable quantity Q1b, (b) the detection criterion and N6 for the observable quantity Q4f.\
\

The 1 \u963  standard deviation is shown as the gray area.\

For the slowly varying emission, Fig. C.3a shows that observation L570725 of \uc0\u964  Bo\'f6tis stands out from the other observations and requires a detailed analysis. This detailed analysis is presented in Sect. 5.1.2.\
\
For the burst emission, Fig. C.3b shows the detection criterion N6 for the observable quantity Q4f. As for panel a, thisis used to identify observations which require a detailed analysis. Figure C.3b shows two observationswhich stand out from the overall distribution, namely L569131 and L545197. L569131 corresponds to the \uc0\u964  Boo observation in which we tentatively identify burst emission (Sect. 5.1.1); L545197 is the observation of \u965  And in which we see a marginal detection (Sect. 5.2).\
\
Appendix D Integrated spectrum (Q1b) plots for all exoplanet observations\
Low-level systematic features in the integrated spectrum (Q1b) are seen in all beams for all the 55 Cnc, \uc0\u965  And, \u964  Boo observations (Fig. D.1). In the \u964  Boo (panel e) and \u965  And (panel c) observations we see a ripple pattern that is likely due to an instrumental effect. Since all the observations are processed identically with the BOREALIS pipeline it is unlikely that the data processing created the ripples since they are not the same in the two different data sets and do not do appear in the 55 Cnc observations.\
\
For each individual observation, the features in the OFF1 and OFF2-beam are equivalent within the error bars as can be demonstrated by subtracting the two beams (bottom panels in the left column of Fig. D.1). We also find for each observation that the ON and OFF-beams are equivalent within the error bars (right column of Fig. D.1) with the exception of observation L570725 (Fig. D.1f). Therefore, any variations in the observing conditions (ionospheric and instrumental) are similar between all beams. We do observe large differences between the OFF beams of different dates showing that the systematics change between observations. However, these systematic features do not change over time in one observation, indicating that they may be caused by either an instrumental effect, by a source that is in the side-lobes, or a combination of both effects. For all observations, the lowest intensity values found are similar (~0.003 of the SEFD or 5.1 Jy) suggesting low-level instrumental noise is always present. The features on top of that are likely caused by a combination of sources in the side lobes and non-uniform instrumental effects.\
\
Specifically, for every \uc0\u964  Boo observation except L570725 there is a bump in the OFF signal at 20-30 MHz. We find that ON-beam feature in observation L570725 has an amplitude comparable to the features seen in both OFF beams in all other \u964  Boo observations (Figs. D.1e\'96f). Only for observation L570725 are the 2 OFF beams lower than every other OFF beam (Fig. D.1e). However, the structure in the dynamic spectrum of the observation L570725 is not the same as in the dates with the large-scale systematics (see Appendix I).\
\

Integrated spectrum (Q1b) for all beams in all observations for 55 Cnc (panels a and b), \uc0\u965  And (panels c and d), and \u964  Boo (panels e and f). Large scale features are seen for all dates, however, they change between observations. Panels c\'96f: ripple pattern that is likely due to an instrumental effect (e.g., imperfect phasing). There are no large-scale differences seen between thetwo OFF beams (bottom plots in panels a, c, and e) for any date. In every individual observation, the two OFF-beams and ON-beam (expect L570725) are equivalent with each other within the pure Gaussian noise error bars (). Dynamic spectrum differences of all OFF beams in every \u964  Boo observation can be found in Fig. I.1. The \u964  Boo ON-beam signal in observation L570725 (orange curve in panel f) is the only large-scale difference between the ON and OFF beams that is seen (bottom plot in all panels). The 20\'9630 MHz features in many of the \u964  Boo b dates are the same order of magnitude as the ON-beam signal in observation L570725 (panel e). The dynamic spectrum of the ON-beam in observation L570725 subtracted by the OFF beams in the other \u964  Boo observationscan be found in Fig. I.1.\

Panel a: Q2 for the ON-beam vs the OFF-beam 2. Panel b: Q2 for the OFF-beam 1 vs. the OFF-beam 2. Panel c: Q4a (number of peaks). Panel d: Q4b (power of peaks). Panel e: Q4e (peak offset). Panel f: Q4f (peak offset). For panels c\'96f the black lines are the ON-beam difference with the OFF beam 2 and the red lines are the OFF beam difference. The dashed lines are statistical limits (1, 2, 3\u963 ) of the difference between all the Q4 values derived using two different Gaussian distributions (each performed 10 000 times). We do not see any excess signal in the ON-beam compared to the OFF-beams. Therefore, this observation is a non-detection for burst emission. We find by performing Gaussian simulations that the probability to obtain the OFF beam curve in Q4f (panel f) is ~73%, whereas the probability to randomly reproduce the ON-beam curve is ~82%.\

Appendix F Statistical significance of slow emission detection in L570725\
To quantify the statistical significance of the detection of a slowly varying signal in observation L570725, we use a method similar to the technique outlined in Turner et al. (2019) for the significance of the Q4f detections (see also Sect. 5.1.1).\
\
We first calculate the observable quantity Q1a for the ON and OFF beam. From this, we obtain the difference between both, Q1a(ON)-Q1a(OFF) = Q1aDiff. We then normalize Q1aDiff by its standard deviation and calculate the average value of the normalized curves, which we denote as 
\f1 \uc0\u10216 
\f0 Q1aDiff
\f1 \uc0\u10217 
\f0 . For observation L570725, we obtain 
\f1 \uc0\u10216 
\f0 Q1aDiff
\f1 \uc0\u10217 
\f0  = 2.7. In the same way, we define 
\f1 \uc0\u10216 
\f0 Q1bDiff
\f1 \uc0\u10217 
\f0  and find 
\f1 \uc0\u10216 
\f0 Q1bDiff
\f1 \uc0\u10217 
\f0  = 8.2.\
\
These values are compared to those obtained in the case when both beams only contain random Gaussian noise. We generated a random distribution of points for the ON and OFF beams (generating an artificial dynamic spectrum with the same number of points) and calculated 
\f1 \uc0\u10216 
\f0 Q1aDiff
\f1 \uc0\u10217 
\f0  and 
\f1 \uc0\u10216 
\f0 Q1bDiff
\f1 \uc0\u10217 
\f0 . We generated over 106 instances ofthis artificial data set. In none of these simulated cases, the value of 
\f1 \uc0\u10216 
\f0 Q1aDiff
\f1 \uc0\u10217 
\f0  and 
\f1 \uc0\u10216 
\f0 Q1bDiff
\f1 \uc0\u10217 
\f0  reached the values obtained in observation L570725. By interpolating the peak values obtained for 
\f1 \uc0\u10216 
\f0 Q1aDiff
\f1 \uc0\u10217 
\f0  and 
\f1 \uc0\u10216 
\f0 Q1bDiff
\f1 \uc0\u10217 
\f0  over a set of N simulations (with N between 105 and 106), we find that the probability to randomly obtain a signal as strong as the observed one is 2.1 \'d7 10\uc0\u8722 12 for Q1aDiff and 1 \'d7 10\u8722 18 for Q1bDiff. This false positive rate corresponds to a statistical significance of 6.9\u963  and 8.6\u963 , respectively.\
\
As a final step, we compare this value to those obtained for the OFF beams. In that case, we find that the false positive rate is ~90% for Q1a(OFF1)-Q1a(OFF2) and ~100% for Q1b(OFF1)-Q1b(OFF2). Therefore, the OFF beams difference clearly corresponds to a non-detection.\
\
We note that this procedure assumes all points in the Q1a and Q1b curves are uncorrelated. In the case of instrumental effects, sources in the side lobe or other systematic errors this assumption does not hold.\
\
Appendix G Pulsar B0809+74 observation L570723\
G.1 Replica signal in OFF-beam\
The observation of the pulsar B0809+74 can be used to independently study the possible systematics (e.g imperfect phasing and low-level noise) affecting the\uc0\u964  Boo observation L570725 (Sect. 5.1.2). The pulsar observation L570723 was taken 15 min before observation L570725. In order to detect B0809+74, we use the same procedure as in Turner et al. (2017a). The FFT was performed on the data after running it through the BOREALIS pipeline and de-dispersing the observations at the known dispersion measure. To get the final power spectrum in the FFT, the 6 first harmonics were folded together. The FFT was computed from the range 30\'9655 MHz. The FFT of the ON-beam, OFF-beam 1, and OFF-beam 2 are shown in Fig. G.1.\

Integrated spectrum (Q1b) for the OFF beams on \uc0\u964  Boo (observation L570725) and the pulsar B0809+74 (observation L570723, taken 15 min before observation L570725). For observation L570725 only the first 15 min of data were used to calculate Q1b to allow for a more consistent comparison with the pular observation. The two observations have similar features in Q1b and above 30 MHz are consistent with each other assuming Gaussian error bars. We performed a K-S test on the two curves above 30 MHz and find that the probability that the two curves are drawn from the same parent distribution (the null hypothesis) is 97%. The fact that the two beams are pointed at completely different parts of the sky and still have similar overall flux levels suggests that the majority of the signal in the beams is instrumental. The 20\'9630 MHz feature in the OFF beam of \u964  Boo observation L570725 is the faint signal replicated from the ON-beam (Sect. 5.1.2; Fig. 6).\
\
Open with DEXTER\
We find that the pulsar is detected with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNFFT) of ~628 in the ON-beam and with SNFFT of ~23 and ~57 in the OFF beams,respectively. This result confirms that a replica signal of the ON-beam can appear in the OFF beam, as was also found in the \uc0\u964  Boo observation L570725 (Sect. 5.1.2; Fig. 6).\
\
G.2 Comparison of integrated spectra (Q1b)\
We also compare the integrated spectra (observable quantity Q1b) of one of the observations of the pulsar B0809+74 to those of the \uc0\u964  Boo observation. Figure G.2 shows Q1b for both OFF beams for the two observations (B0809+74 observation L570723 and \u964  Boo observation L570725). We only used the first 15 minutes of data from the \u964  Boo L570725 observation to derive Q1b to allow for a more consistent comparison. Above 30 MHz, the two observations are consistent with each other within error bars. Additionally, we performed a K-S statistical test on the two curves above 30 MHz and find that the probability that the two curves are drawn from the same parent distribution (the null hypothesis) is 97%. In the frequency range 20\'9630 MHz, the \u964  Boo observation shows large-scale features in both OFF beams; this feature is absent in the pulsar observation. Therefore, the likely source of the 21\'9630 MHz feature in the ON-beam of the \u964  Boo observation L570725 (Fig. 5b) is either excess flux in the beam or an unknown time-dependent instrumental effect.\
\
Appendix H Station inspection plots\
During eachobservation, station summary plots are produced by ASTRON to monitor telescope stability and data quality. We examined these station inspection plots to search for a possible non-planetary cause of the signal seen in the ON-beam of observation L570725. We discovered that in each of our LOFAR observations at least one station was misbehaving (summarised in Table A.1).\
\
In Fig. H.1, we show a few examples for station inspection plots (left-hand panels) and some derived quantities for the \uc0\u964  Boo observation L570725. We compare a good station (CS001), a bad station (CS101), and the incoherent sum of all stations.\
\

Analysis of the station inspection plots for observation L570725. Top row: good station CS001 (panels a, d, g). Middle row:bad station CS101 (panels b, e, h). Bottom row: incoherent (not phased) sum of all stations. Left column (panels a\'96c): station inspection plots. Each plot has been normalized by an average background. Large scale features are seen foe the bad station CS101. Middle column (panels d\'96f): integrated spectra (Q1b) derived from the station inspection plots. Right column (panels g\'96i): time-series (Q1a) derived from the station inspection plots. No large bumps are seen within 20\'9630 MHz for the bad station (CS101), therefore they do not seem to be cause of the L570725 ON-beam signal seen in Fig. 5.\
\
Open with DEXTER\
To directly compare to the observed signal, we digitized the dynamic spectra and calculated the integrated spectrum (Q1b, middle panels) and time-series (Q1a, right-hand panels) for the stations mentioned above. We do not see any large-scale bumps in the range 20\'9630 MHz in Q1b in any of the good or bad stations and also when we combine all 24 stations together (this is an incoherent sum since the phases were not taken into account). Our findings suggest that the spurious behavior seen in the stations plots are not likely the origin of the detected signal discussed in Sect. 5.1.2.}{\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252\cocoartf2577

Abstract\
\
   This document describes the Interplanetary Internet: a communication\
   system to provide Internet-like services across interplanetary\
   distances in support of deep space exploration.  Our approach, which\
   we refer to as bundling, builds a store-and-forward overlay network\
   above the transport layers of underlying networks.  Bundling uses\
   many of the techniques of electronic mail, but is directed toward\
   interprocess communication, and is designed to operate in\
   environments that have very long speed-of-light delays.  We partition\
   the Interplanetary Internet into IPN Regions, and discuss the\
   implications that this has on naming and routing.  We discuss the way\
   that bundling establishes dialogs across intermittently connected\
   internets, and go on to discuss the types of bundle nodes that exist\
   in the interplanetary internet, followed by a discussion of security\
   in the IPN, a discussion of the IPN backbone network, and a\
   discussion of remote deployed internets.\

              Desiderata of Interplanetary Internetworking\
\
   Go thoughtfully in the knowledge that all interplanetary\
   communication derives from the modulation of radiated energy, and\
   sometimes a planet will be between the source and the destination.\
   Therefore rely not on end-to-end connectivity at any time, for the\
   universe does not work that way.\
\
   Neither rely on ample bandwidth, for power is scarce out there and\
   the bit error rates are high.  Know too that signal strength drops\
   off by the square of the distance, and there is a lot of distance.\
\
   Consider the preciousness of interplanetary communication links, and\
   restrict access to them with all your heart.  Protect also the\
   confidentiality of application data or risk losing your customers.\
\
   Remember always that launch mass costs money.  Think not, then, that\
   you may require all the universe to adopt at once the newest\
   technologies.  Be backward compatible.\
\
   Never confuse patience with inaction.  By waiting for acknowledgement\
   to one message before sending the next, you squander tracking pass\
   time that will never come to you again in this life.  Send as much as\
   you can, as early as you can, and meanwhile confidently await\
   responses for as long as they may take to find their way to you.\
\
   Therefore be at peace with physics, and expect not to manage the\
   network in closed control loops -- neither in the limiting of\
   congestion nor in the negotiation of connection parameters nor even\
   in on-demand access to transmission bands.  Each node must make its\
   own operating choices in its own understanding, for all the others\
   are too far away to ask.  Truly the solar system is a large place and\
   each one of us is on his or her own.  Deal with it.\

Foreward\
\
   This document presents the current state of our team's efforts to\
   define an end-to-end architecture for the Interplanetary Internet.\
   This is a "living" document, and is frequently updated.  In this\
   version of the document, we introduce a new construct, a tuple\
   consisting of a topologically significant routing handle and the\
   administrative name.  In this model, the routing handle identifies an\
   "IPN Region," an area of the Interplanetary Internet in which A) the\
   administrative name is resolvable, and in which B) a route can be\
   formed from anywhere within the region to the address returned when\
   the administrative name is resolved.\
\
   On the presumption that the exploration of space will eventually lead\
   to the need for communication among planets, satellites, asteroids,\
   robotic spacecraft and crewed vehicles, our project has a heavy focus\
   on advocating the development of a stable interplanetary backbone\
   network. We have concluded that simply extending the Internet suite\
   to operate end-to-end over interplanetary distances is not feasible.\
   Rather, we envision a "network of internets" _ ordinary internets\
   that are interconnected by a system of gateways that cooperate to\
   form the stable backbone across interplanetary space.  Each\
   internet's protocols are terminated at its local gateway, which then\
   uses a specialized long-haul transport protocol to communicate with\
   peer gateways.  An end-to-end "bundle" protocol will operate above\
   the transport layer to carry necessary information from one internet\
   to another.  Bundling will, to the extent possible, remove any\
   "chattiness" from the local protocols, forming atomic units that will\
   be shipped across the backbone.  Bundles may be protected from\
   unauthorized access and unauthorized modification. The IPN will have\
   a global namespace that is broken into a number of name-to-address\
   binding regions, referred to as IPN regions.  Names carried in the\
   bundles consist of a tuple, one element identifying the destination\
   IPN region and used for routing and a second element that carries the\
   administrative name of the destination in the namespace that is\
   relevant within the destination IPN region.  The administrative name\
   will be bound to an address that is routable within the destination\
   IPN region.  Finally, strong authentication and strict access\
   controls at several levels will protect the IPN from tampering.\
\
   In summary, the best way to envision the fundamental architecture of\
   the Interplanetary Internet is to picture a network of internets.\
   Ordinary internets (many being wireless in nature) are placed on the\
   surface of moons and planets as well as in free-flying spacecraft.\
   These remotely deployed internets run ordinary Internet protocols. A\
   system of Interplanetary Gateways connected by deep-space\
   transmission links form a backbone communication infrastructure that\
   provides connectivity for each of the deployed internets. New long-\
   haul protocols, some confined to the backbone network and some\
   operating end-to-end, allow the deployed internets to communicate\
   with each other.\

\
Executive Summary\
\
   This document describes the Interplanetary Internet: a communication\
   system to provide Internet-like services across interplanetary\
   distances in support of deep space exploration.  The communications\
   environment is characterized by high bandwidth-delay products\
   resulting from very long signal propagation delays, intermittent\
   connectivity that results in long periods of network partitioning,\
   and discontinuities in the capabilities of adjacent networks.  Many\
   of these characteristics are similar to those facing emerging\
   communication services in the terrestrial Internet. For example,\
   terabit networks exhibit very high bandwidth-delay products, mobility\
   can result in partitioning of both nodes and subnetworks, and\
   interconnecting different physical layer technologies can result in\
   "impedance mismatches."  It is possible to build an end-to-end\
   solution to address any of these, but difficult to build one that is\
   adequate for all of them simultaneously.\
\
   The long bandwidth-delay products shared by the IPN and very high-\
   speed terrestrial networks argue in favor of non-chatty communication\
   protocols.  In the IPN, the long delays mean that protocols that use\
   many round-trips to accomplish some task pay a significant time\
   penalty.  In terrestrial terabit networks where switches can forward\
   data very fast but take a (relatively) long time to reconfigure, the\
   penalty is one of lost efficiency in the use of the resources.  Both\
   environments benefit from protocols that pack as much as possible\
   into each transmission and minimize the number of round-trips needed.\
   Thus a file transfer protocol that can place the entire file and\
   associated control information together in a single atomic\
   transaction completes faster within the IPN and makes more efficient\
   use of terrestrial high-speed networks.\
\
   Most of the problems cited above have existed and been considered,\
   albeit separately, during the evolution of what is now the Internet.\
   Many of the solutions, however, represent branches of the Internet's\
   evolutionary tree that have withered and died as a result of the\
   availability of infrastructure to mitigate environmental differences.\
   This effective homogeneity is diminishing, however, with the rapid\
   deployment of new technologies with fundamentally different\
   characteristics, such as wireless communication and Dense Wavelength\
   Division Multiplexing (DWDM) networks.  One solution, electronic\
   mail, provides a means to span very different networks that are not\
   necessarily always connected.  The electronic mail approach has a\
   number of attractions.  First, there is no expectation of continuous\
   or instantaneous connectivity.  Second, electronic mail embodies the\
   concept of indirection as a means of providing store-and-forward\
   traversal of different, sometimes-disconnected networks.  Finally,\
   the electronic mail concept is generally considered to be a non-\
   interactive communications mechanism, potentially well suited to long\
   delay environments.  The electronic mail approach has limitations,\
   though.  Without and end-to-end retransmission mechanism, electronic\
   mail does not provide true end-to-end reliability.  Additionally,\

 \

\
\
\
   electronic mail is oriented toward human use rather than interprocess\
   communication.  Further, the protocol that typically provides\
   electronic mail services in the Internet, SMTP, is highly interactive\
   in its control traffic, even though the electronic mail concept is\
   only minimally interactive.\
\
   Our approach, which we refer to as bundling, builds a store-and-\
   forward overlay network above the transport layers of underlying\
   networks.  Thus two nodes that are adjacent in bundle space may be\
   many hops apart in the context of the underlying network topology.\
   We see the bundle layer as a second "thin waist of the hourglass"\
   that allows applications built on top of it to communicate across\
   discontinuities in connectivity, and to communicate efficiently over\
   a multitude of underlying transport technologies.  This discontinuity\
   in connectivity may result from fluctuations in link availability or\
   from artificial discontinuities, such as are imposed by firewalls.\
   For efficient communication, the bundle layer attempts to minimize\
   interactivity of its control traffic, and expects applications to do\
   likewise.  The bundle layer also provides a level of indirection\
   between applications and the specific services of the underlying\
   network protocols.  Bundle applications can specify requested\
   "handling instructions," such as reliability and quality of service\
   requests that are mapped into the most appropriate mechanisms\
   available in the underlying networks.\
\
   Bundling uses many of the techniques of electronic mail, but is\
   directed toward interprocess communication.  Bundle nodes use the\
   capabilities of the underlying networks, including transport layer\
   retransmission protocols, to effect the transfer of bundles between\
   bundle nodes.  Optional end-to-end reliability at the bundle layer\
   facilitates end-to-end reliability at the application layer.  In\
   addition, the bundle layer allows any bundle node in the path to take\
   custody of a bundle.  When custody is transferred, the receiving\
   bundle node assumes responsibility for delivering the bundle\
   according to its handling instructions, and the previous bundle\
   custodian is allowed to recover its storage resources.  The bundle\
   protocol is designed to function over simplex and half-duplex links,\
   and custody transfers may occur between non-adjacent bundle nodes.\
   Finally, because the bundle layer operates over networks that are\
   often disconnected, the bundle-layer reliability mechanisms adapt the\
   operation of timers to accommodate this episodic connectivity.\
\
   To illustrate how bundling allows connectivity across intermittently\
   connected networks, one could envision a "strobe light" that\
   illuminates the portions of the network's topology that are connected\
   at a given time.  Lit portions of the network are available for\
   bundle forwarding.  If one imagines a high-persistence CRT capturing\
   an ordered sequence of illuminations that proceed from source to\
   destination, one can envision the available routes for bundle\
   forwarding.  This environment, therefore, requires a mechanism to\
   route based on both current and expected connectivity.  This routing\
   mechanism exploits predictability, such as that provided by orbital\

\
\
   mechanics or by scheduled network events (possibly including rate\
   changes, such as "5c Sundays").  It is important to note that this\
   routing mechanism may choose to defer communication even though a\
   current path toward the destination exists, if a substantially more\
   attractive path is expected to become available.\
\
   We believe that the bundle layer functionality has utility within the\
   context of the terrestrial Internet as well.  The Internet is\
   evolving to encompass very different networking technologies,\
   architectures, and applications.  Some of these, such as firewalls,\
   result in logical partitioning of the Internet, while others, such as\
   extreme rate mismatches, may result in inefficient use of network\
   resources.  The bundle layer extends the Internet architecture to\
   provide consistent end-to-end communication in the current and\
   emerging partitioned environments, facilitating the deployment of new\
   applications that can operate reliably while allowing networks to\
   operate efficiently.\

1. Introduction\
\
   The exploration of space began with naked-eye observations of the\
   stars and moon. In more recent centuries, this exploration was aided\
   by new Earth-based technologies such as optical and radio telescopes.\
   Even more recently, we have placed observing resources into near\
   Earth orbit, such as the Hubble Space Telescope. We have also sent\
   robotic missions to other parts of the Solar system for a closer\
   look.\
\
   It is the latter activity -- the current exploration of the Solar\
   System by robotic means and possibly later by missions crewed by\
   people -- that motivates our interest in an Interplanetary Internet.\
   The new technology of the terrestrial Internet needs to be extended\
   into space. We believe that the creation and adoption of Internet-\
   friendly standards for space communication will enhance our ability\
   to build a common interplanetary communication infrastructure.  We\
   think this infrastructure will be needed to support he expansion of\
   human intelligence throughout the Solar System.  The current\
   terrestrial Internet and its technology provide a robust basis to\
   support these missions in an efficient and scalable manner.\
\
   Although many missions during the last 40 years of space exploration\
   have by necessity provided a substantial portion of their own\
   communication resources, a significant amount of shared\
   infrastructure is already in place. For example, the multi-mission\
   Deep Space Network (DSN) provides a complex of large-diameter (up to\
   70-meter) tracking and data acquisition dishes at three points on the\
   Earth's surface, each about 120 degrees from each other. Similarly,\
   the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) and a global\
   network of small ground tracking stations are used to relay data to\
   and from many near-Earth missions.\
\
   In terms of the communications protocols that support space\
   exploration, the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems\
   (CCSDS) has for almost twenty years been developing internationally\
   agreed standards for the physical and link layers that interconnect\
   remote spacecraft with their ground control systems. NASA, through\
   CCSDS, has also been working since 1993 on general application of\
   terrestrial Internet or Internet-like protocols for space data use.\
   Such standardization opens up the possibility of re-purposing and re-\
   using existing and planned communication facilities for multiple\
   subsequent missions.\
\
   Early in 1998, it became apparent to our team that the space\
   communications research community and the Internet research and\
   development community were pursuing technology paths that can\
   potentially lead to a kind of convergence. A few members of the\
   Internet community began thinking about adaptation of the terrestrial\
   Internet to deep space communications. The space communications\

 \

\
\
\
   research community was already trying out variants of the Internet's\
   TCP/IP protocol suite to support space-based applications. Mutual\
   recognition led to the formation of a program of work that was aimed\
   at extending the notion of Internet to interplanetary scale. The\
   heretofore-independent "rivers" of evolving space technology and\
   Internet technology are converging in this program.\
\
   To realize this convergence, the effort to define the IPN\
   architecture is being undertaken at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory\
   (JPL) that is operated by the California Institute of Technology\
   (Caltech) for the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration\
   (NASA). Partial funding for the effort comes from the US Defense\
   Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) that sponsored the original\
   Internet design work starting in 1973 and its predecessors, such as\
   the ARPANET, in 1969. NASA supplies in-kind support and staffing\
   through its standardization program with CCSDS as well as program\
   involvement from the Mars exploration enterprise.\
\
   An Interplanetary Internet Research Group (IPNRG) has been formed\
   under the auspices of the Internet Research Task Force of the\
   Internet Society and an Interplanetary Internet Special Interest\
   Group has also been created as a means of keeping the public informed\
   as to progress.\
\
   Early protocol design phases are underway now and prototype testing\
   of candidate designs is anticipated within a year. Demonstration of\
   these protocols in terrestrial environments will likely occur during\
   2001 and plans for their use in interplanetary contexts are under\
   consideration as part of the NASA Mars mission in the years beyond\
   2003. The Mars exploration program is particularly interesting as a\
   "reference model" for our work, since it includes a "Mars Network"\
   project that hopes to deploy a series of remote communications\
   satellites into orbit around the planet. These satellites will be\
   dedicated to servicing the local communication and positioning\
   requirements of the other in-orbit and surface observation and\
   exploration missions that are in the vicinity of the planet. By 2010,\
   as many as seven communications and navigation satellites could be in\
   orbit around Mars, most in low Mars orbit (LMO) but with perhaps at\
   least one in an "areo" synchronous orbit that is analogous to a\
   geosynchronous orbit around the Earth.\
\
1.1.   Preliminary Considerations\
\
   The remarkable success and growth of the Earth-bound TCP/IP protocols\
   of the Internet illustrate the power of communication\
   standardization. The simplicity of the Internet architecture, with\
   its layered structure, contributes to its ability to adapt to almost\
   any underlying communication capability. As with the terrestrial\
   Internet, the ultimate test of the IPN technology is whether it\
   successfully supports commercial applications that have a space\
   component. We expect that space will eventually be commercialized -\
   not only for communication services, but also for mining the\

\
\
   asteroids, for the operation of space-based hotels, for manufacturing\
   and medical treatments, and for general tourism. While such\
   developments may still lie decades in the future, the potential\
   investment and benefits can be appreciated as we contemplate the\
   explosion of new markets associated with the commercialization of the\
   Internet that began only ten years ago, in 1990. We will therefore\
   architect the Interplanetary Internet in anticipation of possibly\
   rapid commercialization.\
\
   In terms of technologies, the current Internet capabilities work well\
   on Earth where the propagation delay of light-speed signals is short.\
   The packets exchanged according to the TCP protocol reach their\
   destination in fractions of a second, for the most part. The TCP/IP\
   protocols (a system of over 150 related communication standards), are\
   therefore expected to work just as well on the surface of other\
   planets or moons, on space craft and orbiting space stations, all of\
   which involve data exchange over fairly short distances, subject to\
   the availability of sufficient power to maintain good signal-to-noise\
   ratios. However tempting it is to employ similar concepts in\
   extending the Internet into deep space, there are problems - deep\
   space communications really still are "rocket science." The distances\
   between the planets are, well, astronomical. For example, the round-\
   trip propagation delays - at the speed of light - between Earth and\
   Mars range from about 8 minutes to over 40 minutes. This makes\
   "chatty" protocols like TCP relatively unattractive because of their\
   heavy dependence on near real-time exchanges between the\
   communicating parties.\
\
   These large distances also impair the data rates that can be\
   sustained because of radio signal degradation and attenuation.\
   Moreover, the celestial mechanics of the solar system mean that the\
   distances between the planets change with time. While these changes\
   are essentially calculable, they still cause variations in delay, in\
   transmission capacity and occasionally in connectivity due to\
   occultation of satellites as they orbit a planet, or of ground-based\
   facilities as planets rotate.\
\
   Size, weight and - most of all - power are supreme challenges for\
   space-based communication systems, as they are for ground-based\
   mobile systems. Launching mass into interplanetary trajectories,\
   injecting mass into orbit, and landing mass into the gravity well of\
   another planet is currently very expensive. Mass translates directly\
   into the local availability of power. Efficient use of the\
   communications channel allows more information to be carried per unit\
   of transmitted power. But power limitations introduce asymmetries in\
   the communication capacities available between Earth, for example,\
   and the remote spacecraft and planets. There can be factors of ten or\
   more differences between the data rate that can be received on Earth\
   and the rates of reception of off-Earth resources. It is quite common\
   to be able to receive transmissions from Mars at 100 kilobits/second\
   while the Mars-based systems may only receive from Earth at 1\
   kilobits/second.\

 \
Internet Draft       draft-irtf-ipnrg-arch-00.txt        May 2001\
\
\
\
\
   All of these effects combine to make the design of an interplanetary\
   backbone communication system a considerable challenge. The Deep\
   Space Network - the current interplanetary backbone - uses its three\
   terrestrial communication complexes to communicate with spacecraft,\
   orbiting satellites and ground-based resources on moons or other\
   planets of the Solar System.  Because these resources must be shared\
   among many missions, it is necessary to schedule them to be aimed in\
   particular directions at particular times. Time synchronization is\
   needed among the various parts of such a system. For example, a\
   signal from Mars may take 20 minutes to reach Earth, at which time,\
   the appropriate antenna of the Deep Space network must be aimed\
   properly to receive the transmission, 20 minutes after it was sent.\
   This same antenna might then have to be repositioned to send data to\
   another spacecraft elsewhere in the Solar System, and the receiving\
   system must be ready to receive that transmission at the right time.\
   In some ways, this problem is somewhat like the problem of scheduling\
   trains on railroad tracks; since multiple trains use the tracks, they\
   must be scheduled to avoid collisions.\
\
1.2.     The IPN Operating Environment\
\
   There are a number of fundamental differences between the\
   environments for terrestrial communications and those we envision for\
   the IPN.  These differences include delay, low and asymmetric\
   bandwidth, intermittent connectivity, and a relatively high bit error\
   rate.  Taking these into account affects the entire model for\
   communicating; shifting us from the "telephony" model implicit in\
   current Internet communications to the "Postal", or "Pony Express,"\
   model. We will first therefore describe the environmental differences\
   between terrestrial communications and the IPN and gives a brief\
   accounting of why the standard Internet protocol for reliable\
   transport, TCP, is unsuitable for end-to-end communications in the\
   IPN.\
\
   The most obvious difference between communicating between points on\
   Earth and communicating between planets is the delay.  While round-\
   trip times in the terrestrial Internet range from milliseconds to a\
   few seconds, round-trip times to Mars range from 8 to 40 minutes,\
   depending on the planet's position, and round-trip times between\
   Earth and Europa run between 66 and 100 minutes.  In addition to the\
   propagation delay, communicating over interplanetary distances\
   currently requires special equipment (large antennas, high-\
   performance receivers, etc.).  For most deep-space missions, even\
   non-NASA ones, these are currently provided by NASA's Deep Space\
   Network (DSN). The communication resources of the DSN are currently\
   oversubscribed and will probably continue to be so in the future.\
   While studies have been done as to the feasibility of upgrading or\
   replacing the current DSN, the number of deep space missions will\
   probably continue to grow faster than the terrestrial infrastructure\
   needed to support them, making over-subscription a persistent\
   problem.\
\
Cerf, et al.             Expires November 2001                 [Page 11]\
 \
Internet Draft       draft-irtf-ipnrg-arch-00.txt        May 2001\
\
\
\
\
   This over-subscription means that the round-trip times experienced by\
   packets will be affected not only by the propagation delay, but also\
   by the scheduling and queuing delays imposed by the Earth-based\
   resources.  Thus packets to a given destination may have to be queued\
   until the next scheduled contact period, which may be hours, days, or\
   even weeks away.  While queuing and scheduling delays are generally\
   known well in advance except when missions need emergency service\
   (such as during landings and maneuvers), the long and highly variable\
   delays make the design of timers, and retransmission timers in\
   particular, quite difficult.  This again forms a point of departure\
   from the current Internet model, as IPN-aware applications will\
   probably need ways to track the status of a communication and to\
   apprise users of the expected delay before a response can be\
   expected.  This will be complicated once the IPN moves from its\
   initial Earth-centric approach to a peer-to-peer network, since\
   notifying users of the progress of their communications will itself\
   consume precious bandwidth within the network.\
\
   The combined effects of large distances, the expense and difficulty\
   of deploying large antennas to distant planets, and the difficulty in\
   generating power in space all mean that the available bandwidth for\
   communications in the IPN will likely be modest compared to\
   terrestrial systems.  Data rates on the order of hundreds of kilobits\
   per second to a few megabits per second will probably be the norm for\
   the next few decades.  Another characteristic prevalent in today's\
   deep-space missions is bandwidth asymmetry, where data is transmitted\
   at different rates in different directions.  Current missions are\
   usually designed with a much higher data return rate (from space to\
   Earth) than command rate.  The reason for the asymmetry is simple:\
   nobody ever wanted a high-rate command channel, and, all else being\
   equal, it was deemed better to have a more reliable command channel\
   than a faster one.  This design choice has led to data rate\
   asymmetries in excess of 100:1, sometimes approaching 1000:1.  A\
   strong desire for a very robust command channel will probably remain,\
   so that any transport protocol designed for use in the IPN will need\
   to function with a relatively low bandwidth outbound channel to\
   spacecraft / landers.\
\
   The difficulties of generating power on and around other planets will\
   also result in relatively high bit error rates.  Current deep-space\
   missions operate with very high bit error rates (on the order of 10e-\
   1, or one error in ten bits) that are then improved using heavy\
   coding.  The tradeoffs between coding, bit error rate, and\
   reliability requirements will need to be reexamined in the context of\
   the IPN.\
\
   Finally, interplanetary communications will, at least in the near\
   future, be characterized by intermittent connectivity between nodes.\
   As satellites or moons pass behind planets, and as planets pass\
   behind the sun as seen from Earth, we lose the ability to communicate\
   with them.  This effect adds to the delays experienced by packets,\

\
\
   and could push queuing delays to several weeks or a month if the\
   source and destination are in opposition (on opposite sides of the\
   sun).  Inter-layer signaling, especially from the link layer to\
   provide notifications of such breaks in connectivity, will probably\
   be required.\
\
   We see the IPN growing outwards from Earth as we explore more and\
   more planets, moons, asteroids, and possibly other stars.  Thus there\
   will always be a fringe to the fabric of the IPN, an area without a\
   rich communications infrastructure.  As a result, the data rate,\
   connectivity, and error characteristics mentioned above will probably\
   always be an issue somewhere in the IPN.  For the more highly\
   developed core areas of the IPN, it is interesting to note that delay\
   is the only truly immutable characteristic that differentiates the\
   IPN from terrestrial communications.  Data rates, intermittent\
   connectivity, and bit error rate can all be mitigated or eliminated\
   by adding additional infrastructure, in theory if not in practice.\
   Additional infrastructure can also mitigate the scheduling and\
   queuing delays mentioned above, but the propagation delays will\
   remain unless and until we find a way to transmit information faster\
   than the speed of light.\
\
   These environmental characteristics: long delays, low and asymmetric\
   bandwidth, intermittent connectivity, and relatively high error rate\
   make using unmodified TCP/IP for end to end communications in the IPN\
   infeasible.  Using the equations from Mathis, et al [ref:\
   http://www.psc.edu/networking/papers/model_ccr97.ps], we can\
   calculate an upper bound on the sustainable throughput of a TCP\
   connection, taking into account TCP's congestion avoidance\
   mechanisms.  Even if only 1 in 100 million packets are lost, a TCP\
   connection to Mars is limited to just under 250kbps.  If we assume\
   that 1 in 5000 packets is lost (this figure was reported by Paxson as\
   the packet corruption rate in the Internet ref:\
   ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/papers/vp-thesis/dis.ps.gz caution: very large\
   file) then that number falls to around 1,600bps.  These values are\
   upper bounds on steady-state throughput; since the number of packets\
   in a connection will generally be under 10,000, TCP performance would\
   be dominated by its behavior during slow-start.  Even when Mars is at\
   its closest approach to Earth, this means that it would take a TCP\
   nearly 100 minutes to ramp up to a transmission rate of 20kbps.  Lab\
   experiments using a channel emulator and standard applications show\
   that even if TCP could be pushed to work efficiently at such\
   distances, many applications either rely on several rounds of\
   handshaking or have built-in timers that render them non-functional\
   when the round-trip-time is pushed over a couple of minutes.  It\
   typically takes eight round trips for FTP to get to a state where\
   data can begin flowing, for example, and an FTP server may time out\
   and reset the connection after 5 minutes of inactivity.  This means\
   that a conformant standard FTP server could be unusable for\
   communicating even with the closest planets.\

1.3.     A "Postal" Communications Model\
\
   We have concluded that the standard Internet protocols should be\
   essentially "terminated" at the Interplanetary Gateways and the\
   information payloads conveyed through a new set of protocols better\
   suited to the long distances, variable delays and asymmetric data\
   rates of the interplanetary backbone network.  In essence, the design\
   is analogous to a kind of postal relay system in which messages are\
   delivered to the intermediate Interplanetary Gateways, extracted from\
   their standard Internet protocols, and encapsulated in new link and\
   transport protocols to be forwarded to the next IPN gateway and\
   ultimately into the target internet.\
\
   Internet electronic mail already works in this fashion but the\
   transfer of files, the operation of the World Wide Web, and remote\
   interactive applications do not fit into this model directly. There\
   are circumstances under which researchers on planet Earth do need an\
   ability to interact with remote devices, for example to steer wheeled\
   robotic vehicles around on the surface. But because of the enormous\
   round-trip delays, such systems must work very indirectly. For\
   example, to steer the Mars Pathfinder rover, one sends instructions\
   about intermediate points that the robot must steer past. This is\
   analogous to automatic airplane pilots that are given a series of\
   coordinates through which to pass. In effect, a planned itinerary is\
   sent and the robot vehicle executes the plan, dealing with local\
   conditions as required.\
\
   The "store-and-forward" nature of this communication method is\
   reminiscent of bucket brigades, except that the contents of the\
   buckets are actually the payloads (i.e. data) of the applications\
   that utilize the network. The concept of "custody" is important in\
   such a system. A sender does not relinquish a copy of a transmission\
   until it is sure that the next in line has successfully received it.\
\
2. IPN Architectural Overview\
\
   We now consider five broad areas that represent areas of significant\
   research in the Interplanetary Internet architecture:\
\
    *  The communication conducted between independent internets\
       (termed "Inter-internet dialogs")\
    *  The architecture and functions of the unique nodes of the\
       Interplanetary Internet\
    *  A security architecture for meeting anticipated data and\
       infrastructure protection needs\
    *  The issues in developing a stable backbone network for the\
       Interplanetary Internet\
    *  The issues in deploying internets on remote planets, asteroids,\
       and spacecraft\
\
   The following five sections of this document consider each of these\
   areas.  Following these sections we present our conclusions to-date.\

3. Inter-Internet Dialogs\
\
   This section first presents four principles that guide the design of\
   the Interplanetary Internet.  In doing so, we introduce the concept\
   of the "bundle" layer, a protocol layer providing end-to-end service\
   in the IPN.  The section continues by discussing the information\
   carried by the bundle layer, and concludes by discussing reliability\
   at the bundle layer.\
\
3.1.   Principles of Design\
\
3.1.1. Name Tuples Consisting of Administrative and Routing Parts are\
       the Means of Reference\
\
   In the (terrestrial) Internet, names are administrative in nature,\
   and are hierarchically organized.  The Domain Name System (DNS) uses\
   a highly distributed database to translate the name to a numeric\
   address, and addresses are the common medium used throughout the\
   network for reference.  This scheme has worked well in the Internet,\
   but the emergence of network address translators and other\
   partitioning mechanisms have begun to cause some problems with this\
   scheme.\
\
   One of the problems involved with using DNS names across\
   interplanetary space is the distributed nature of the DNS database.\
   This means that it is entirely possible for the portion of the\
   database that can resolve a name to its address to be far (very far,\
   in the Interplanetary Internet) from the host requesting resolution.\
   This means that the times required to resolve names to addresses can\
   become impossibly high, especially when the issues of intermittent\
   connectivity come into play.  The DNS has a mechanism to replicate\
   portions of its database, using a technique known as zone transfers.\
   However, this is not a good solution in the Interplanetary Internet,\
   either.  One could easily spend all of the available communication\
   time transferring the ".com" zone to another planet, rather than\
   actually transferring data.  Clearly, another approach is indicated.\
\
   In our initial designs, we considered creating a new top-level\
   domain, e.g. ".sol", and assigning to it topological significance.\
   We constructed a scheme by which we routed on the "most significant"\
   portions of the domain name, such as ".mars.sol", and essentially bet\
   that these portions would be topologically significant, rather than\
   administratively significant.  This scheme, while attractive from the\
   standpoint of making use of existing infrastructure, makes use of\
   that infrastructure in a bad way.  We were forced to "grandfather"\
   existing top-level domain names to be bound to Earth's Internet, so\
   that ".com" meant ".com ON EARTH."  This spawned philosophical\
   debates within the group regarding sovereignty and the current top-\
   level domain structure within the internet, but also had the\
   potential of creating serious technical problems.  For example, some\
\
Cerf, et al.             Expires November 2001                 [Page 15]\
 \
Internet Draft       draft-irtf-ipnrg-arch-00.txt        May 2001\
\
\
\
   organizations encode geographic information at fairly low levels of\
   their DNS names (consider "zurich.ibm.com", and then consider\
   "mars.ibm.com").  If all ".com's" are shipped off to Earth, the\
   "mars.ibm.com" data is going to take a serious detour.  We eventually\
   concluded that this was not the right approach.\
\
   We have concluded that names in the Interplanetary Internet should\
   consist of a tuple that contains the administrative part plus a\
   routing part.  These names must be carried end-to-end throughout the\
   Interplanetary Internet.  The routing part serves the purpose of the\
   new top-level domain described above, except that it is not required\
   to conform to the naming conventions of the Domain Name System (i.e.,\
   it may be numeric rather than textual), it may be hierarchically\
   organized, and it must be routed.  This requires us to develop the\
   means for computing and distributing routing information, but\
   relieves us from a dependence on the relationship between\
   administrative names and network topology.\
\
3.1.2. The Routing Part of an IPN Tuple Identifies an Internet\
\
   The routing portion of the name identifies an IPN Region.  We\
   envision the IPN as a "network of Internets", and the IPN Region, to\
   some extent, allows us to route to a particular Internet.  The use of\
   an IPN Region is an explicit form of aggregation that is not\
   otherwise possible using administrative names.\
\
   It is necessary and sufficient that the administrative portion of an\
   IPN name be resolvable to a useful address within its IPN Region.  We\
   are currently treating the structure of the routing part of the name\
   in a manner similar to the structure of DNS names:  the name space of\
   the routing part is a tree of text labels separated by "dots," with\
   the root node of the space having a null label.  We denote a name in\
   the IPN in the following manner:  \{administrative part, routing\
   part\}.  So, if "earth.sol" were an IPN Region encompassing the entire\
   Earth, the web site for the Internet Society's IPN Special Interest\
   Group would be \{ www.ipnsig.org, earth.sol\}.\
\
   In order that any node in the IPN be able to send data to any other\
   node, the routing part of the name must be interpretable everywhere.\
   That is, any IPN node, when confronted with any valid IPN Region\
   name, must be able to identify a transport layer destination that\
   moves the data toward that region.\
\
3.1.3. The "Bundle Layer" Terminates Local Transport Protocols and\
       Operates End-to-End\
\
   In the IPN, we cannot ever assume that there is direct connectivity\
   between source and destination.  That is, we cannot assume that bits\
   emitted by a source can travel, delayed only by routing and\
   transmission delays, to the destination.  There may be any number of\
   reasons for this, ranging from physical (the destination is on the\
   far side of a distant planet and can't communicate with anything\
\

\
\
\
   right now), to schedule-related (a required IPN gateway is currently\
   serving other customers), to administrative (the source is only on\
   during the day, the destination only during the night).  For the\
   long-haul links of the backbone, information will almost certainly\
   have to be stored for some amount of time as the antennas used for\
   the long-haul links will almost surely be highly directional.\
\
   Thus depending on the schedules of the nodes involved and the\
   possibility of high-priority interrupt traffic, the nodes that make\
   up the IPN may have to buffer data for hours, days, or weeks before\
   it can be forwarded.  Also, the highly varying communications\
   environments that will make up the IPN, ranging from optical fiber on\
   Earth to wireless communications around Mars, to the long-haul links\
   of the backbone, suggest that different transport protocols will be\
   needed for the different environments. It makes sense, therefore, for\
   the IPN nodes to terminate the transport-layer protocols used in the\
   respective IPN regions, holding data at a higher layer before\
   forwarding it on, possibly using a different transport-layer\
   protocol.\
\
   We call this higher layer the "bundle layer," and the protocol used\
   to send data between the various nodes of the IPN the "bundle\
   protocol."  The term "bundle" is used to connote the store-and-\
   forward aspect of communications where as much interactivity as\
   possible has been distilled out of the communication.  A bundle file\
   transfer request, for example, might contain the user's\
   authentication (login/password, e.g.), the location of the file to\
   get, and where that file should be delivered in the requester's IPN\
   domain.  All of this information would be transmitted as one atomic\
   "bundle," and the requested file would be returned. We use the term\
   "bundle" rather than "transaction" to avoid notions of two-phase and\
   three-phase commitment that are commonly associated with transaction\
   processing.\
\
   In traditional networking terminology it is generally the transport-\
   layer protocol that operates end-to-end.  Since IPN nodes terminate\
   transport layer protocols in order to buffer data and to enable them\
   to use a transport protocol appropriate to the IPN region through\
   which data will be sent, it is the bundle layer in the IPN that\
   operates end-to-end.\
\
   It should be noted that terminating the transport protocols at the\
   IPN nodes decouples the internets in different IPN regions to a\
   significant degree.  This has the desirable effect of also decoupling\
   the evolutionary rates of those internets: changes in the Earth's\
   Internet do not necessarily dictate changes in other internets.  This\
   is important in an environment in which resources are and will\
   continue to be severely constrained.\
\
   Figure 1 illustrates the progression of a bundle of data through the\
   Interplanetary Internet, from its source at host "A" to the\
   destination at host "E."  Custody transfers are indicated by\
\

   asterisks (*), and occur at B, C, D, and E.  Host "A" initiates the\
   bundle transfer, and the bundle is transferred using internet\
   protocols (i.e., TCP and IP) to bundle node "B", which serves as the\
   gateway between the left-hand internet and the interplanetary\
   backbone.  The box icon indicates that custody of the bundle is\
   transferred to that gateway.  When conditions permit, the bundle is\
   forwarded on to the next hop in the store-and-forward chain.  In this\
   case the next hop is another host within the interplanetary backbone\
   network: host "C".\
\
   Also illustrated in Figure 1 is the notion of a "return receipt" sent\
   by the ultimate destination of the data back to the source.  This is\
   an optional service, much like a return receipt within the postal\
   system. If the source desires notification of delivery, that is\
   accomplished by a separate return receipt, which is transmitted as\
   its own bundle, and is subject to the same custody transfers as the\
   original transmission (similar to the fact that a postal return\
   receipt is, in itself, a postcard).  It is shown figuratively as\
   bypassing the forwarding path (E to D to C to B to A), but this is\
   simply for clarity.  The return receipt is forwarded in exactly the\
   same manner as the original data is.\

\
   Many aspects of this mode of data transfer resemble the postal\
   system, or even the Pony Express.  The source depends on the store-\
   and-forward nodes in the chain to operate on its behalf to deliver\
   data that may not be retained at the source.  Source notification\
   that the destination has received the data is optional, and there is\
   no guarantee or even any firm expectation on the part of the source\
   about when the data will be delivered.\

\
   layer(s), and operates end-to-end between the ultimate source and the\
   ultimate destination of the data.  The bundle layer provides a number\
   of services to applications using it. For example the bundle layer\
   carries the source and destination name tuples end-to-end to support\
   the late binding of the destination name's administrative part to an\
   address.  The bundle layer also carries the users' specifications for\
   reliability, quality of service, and security.  Because the\
   communication resources are precious, it is desirable to provide\
   error recovery mechanisms that do not necessitate discarding of\
   bundles that contain errors.  We are considering adding to the\
   information carried in a bundle some information to assist in\
   transfer-related error handling.  We are thinking in terms of active\
   networking, using a combination of active packets and active nodes as\
   a means of specifying appropriate actions to take in the event of\
   problems in completing the transfer.  Additionally, the bundle layer\
   provides invoking applications with a transfer identifier that is\
   carried with the bundle, and is used in "return receipts." [Ref:\
   http://www.comsoc.org/pubs/surveys/1q99issue/psounis.html]\
\
3.2.   Information Carried by the Bundle Layer\
\
   To effect the end-to-end transfers necessary in the IPN, the bundle\
   layer must carry some information end-to-end.  This section documents\
   our current thinking on the information that must be carried end-to-\
   end, and notes which of those data elements may be supplied by the\
   application using the bundle service.\
\
    *  Bundle Identifier: this is a monotonically increasing number\
       that is carried in the bundle, and also returned to the\
       application to support return receipt processing.  It is not\
       necessarily a sequence number, and as a result, there is no\
       requirement that the value of Bundle Identifiers increase\
       consecutively.  The requirement for monotonicity derives from a\
       need to provide robustness against system crashes, and therefore\
       must be persistent across system crashes.\
    *  Remote entity name: this is the IPN name of the remote bundle\
       agent, and is a tuple, as described above.  It is supplied by\
       the local application using the bundle service.\
    *  Source entity name: this is the IPN name of the local bundle\
       agent, and is a tuple.  It is supplied by the local bundle\
       service, since a particular host may have multiple names and one\
       may be chosen based on routing decisions or other criteria\
       opaque to the application (as in multihomed hosts).  The source\
       name may be returned to the application to support return\
       receipt processing.\
    *  Authentication information: this is information, such as a\
       digital signature, that is passed by the application to the\
       bundle layer to unambiguously identify the source of the bundle.\
       (Just what the source of the bundle is, person, place, address,\
       etc. is still undecided.)  This information is checked for\
       validity at both the source bundle agent and the destination\
       bundle agent.  The authentication information may also be used\

\
\
\
       for access control purposes within the network.\
    *  Source application instance handle: this is similar in nature to\
       a source port number in that it identifies the sending\
       application.  Since bundles are inherently non-interactive, the\
       typical use for this handle is to "reanimate" the source\
       application when a return receipt arrives.  This could be hours,\
       days, or weeks after the initial transmission, so the handle may\
       well be a reference to a structure that allows the application\
       to be reinstantiated with known state.  The source application\
       instance handle may be used at the destination as an identifier,\
       but may also be redundant with the end-to-end authentication\
       information for this purpose.  This handle is supplied by the\
       source application.\
    *  Destination application instance handle: this is essentially the\
       destination port identifier.   As with ports, these must be\
       known to and supplied by the source application.  We have not\
       yet fully explored the implications of port advertisement across\
       the IPN.\
    *  Size of data: this is a statement of the size of the bundle, in\
       bytes.  It is supplied by the source application, and is used\
       initially to ensure that sufficient space is available to store\
       the bundle for its initial transmission.  Nodes receiving\
       transmitted bundles use this information in the same manner: as\
       a means of making a determination about the availability of\
       storage early in the bundle handling process.  In forming the\
       initial bundle, the bundle layer at the source may use the size\
       of data parameter as a consistency check on the amount of data\
       actually delivered.\
    *  Handling instructions: these are parameters supplied by the user\
       with the bundle that convey the user's preferences to the\
       network.  Our thoughts on just exactly what these parameters\
       look like are not yet firm, however, our thoughts are that they\
       include some or all of the following: priority, quality of\
       service (although we are still debating what this means in the\
       context of the IPN), elapsed time after which the content of\
       this bundle is meaningless (time to live as specified by the\
       user), reliability requirements, and any error handling\
       information.  For the most part, these are requests, and we\
       perceive that the bundle layer may either override some or all\
       of these requests or fail the request if local policy does not\
       permit that particular user to make that particular request at\
       that particular time.\
    *  Data Descriptor: This is a reservation token that is generated\
       by the bundle layer.  Its detailed definition and use are still\
       to be determined.\
    *  Time to Live: This is the time after which this bundle is to be\
       discarded from the network.  It is present to facilitate the\
       recovery of network resources and to terminate routing loops,\
       should they occur.\
    *  Loose/Strict Source Route and Record: This information is\
       provided by the source application to facilitate debugging of\
       the network.  It consists of a list of names of IPN nodes\

\
\
\
       through which the bundle must pass on its way to the\
       destination, and our intent is that it should behave similarly\
       to the corresponding option within IP.\
    *  Current bundle custodian: the bundle protocol supports store-\
       and-forward operation in which the custody of a bundle (that is,\
       the responsibility for ensuring reliable delivery) may transfer\
       from one IPN node to another as the bundle progresses through\
       the IPN.  There is not a requirement for each IPN node\
       encountered to assume custody of a bundle.  As a result, it is\
       necessary to identify the upstream node that has custody of the\
       bundle, in order to either request retransmissions or to accept\
       custody of the bundle.\
    *  User data: this is intended to be all of the data that the\
       remote entity requires to perform whatever operation is\
       requested.  Since the environmental characteristics of the IPN\
       make interactivity difficult, the notion is that all of the\
       information that is required to perform a particular\
       "transaction" would be provided in a single bundle.\
\
3.3.   Reliability at the Bundle Layer\
\
   Because no single transport-layer protocol operates end-to-end across\
   the IPN, end-to-end reliability can only be assured at the bundle\
   layer.  At each node along an end-to-end route, the bundle-layer\
   protocol entity passes bundle data to the Transport layer for\
   transmission.  Each bundle layer entity is highly confident that the\
   transport layer will successfully convey the data entrusted to it to\
   the next bundle-layer protocol entity (which may "take custody" of\
   the data or merely relay it; a single hop).  But failures are\
   possible (e.g., a host computer does an unplanned reboot).  Just in\
   case the highly unlikely happens and a Transport-layer transmission\
   fails, the first subsequent node that detects the failure and is\
   capable of taking custody of the bundle will request that the prior\
   custodian re-transmit any missing data (again using Transport-level\
   transmission services across, potentially, one or more relay nodes).\
\
   The bundle layer's confidence in the effectiveness of the underlying\
   Transport-layer protocols is reflected in the design of the timers\
   for bundle-layer reliability.  These timers are highly optimistic _\
   that is, they expire as late as possible _ in order to give the\
   Transport protocols every opportunity to complete reliable\
   transmission.  The effect of this optimism is to minimize the chance\
   of unnecessary bundle-layer retransmission, which could seriously\
   degrade IPN performance by consuming valuable bandwidth.\
\
3.4.   Bandwidth Allocation via Market Mechanisms:  "Starbucks"\
\
   To promote effective and efficient use of the IPN's scarce\
   transmission resources, some sort of sophisticated and adaptable\
   bandwidth allocation system will probably be needed.  The scheme\
   described below is based on a free-market notion of "fare-paying\
   packets", where at initial transmission each bundle is issued a\
\

 \

\
\
\
   "draft" on some small percentage of IPN resources.  These resources\
   might well map back to actual monetary funds provided by the\
   originator of the bundle to the provider(s) of the IPN service.  The\
   bundle in effect pays its own way across the various legs of end-to-\
   end transmission.  As it traverses each hop, the bundle spends funds\
   from its original draft until either it is received or else its funds\
   are exhausted.  If a bundle is dropped due to insufficient funds then\
   the hope is that all available transmission resources were allocated\
   to bundles that were allotted more funds and therefore were\
   presumably more important (to somebody).\
\
   At the initial Send-bundle service request, the source application\
   (bundle sender) would specify total funds allocated to getting the\
   bundle delivered to the destination.  Total funds allocation needs to\
   be a function of (a) the total number of bytes of data and metadata\
   to be sent, and (b) the prices charged for each "transmission class,"\
   (something like First Class, Business Class, Economy Class, Steerage,\
   Overhead Bin; etc.).  The allocation should cover the anticipated\
   costs of traversing all the bundle hops along the anticipated route\
   to destination.  If the bundle must be split up into multiple packets\
   (bindles, segments), the bundle agent that performs the split also\
   distributes the bundle's total funds among individual packets.  This\
   distribution will probably be on a prorated basis.\
\
   Also, the source application would supply the bundle (and, by\
   implication, each of its packets) with traveling instructions:\
\
   For each time epoch that elapses while awaiting transmission from any\
   single bundle transmission agent:\
\
    *  The length of the epoch in units of time (seconds?)\
    *  The queue (transmission class) to wait in over the course of the\
       epoch\
\
   For example: get in the Steerage queue, but if 30 minutes pass and\
   you still haven't been transmitted then pay for an upgrade to\
   Business Class; if you still haven't been transmitted after 20\
   minutes in Business Class, then give up.\
\
   At each bundle transmission agent, each packet is handled as follows:\
\
    *  For each of the packet's authorized time epochs until the packet\
       is transmitted (that is, initially handed to the underlying\
       communication layer; retention until successful custody\
       acquisition by downstream agent is provided at no charge):\
\
       - If (epoch duration * packet length * agent's price per unit of\
         time per byte for this epoch's transmission class, i.e. queue)\
         is greater than packet's residual funds, then discard the\
         packet.  The packet's residual funds remain unexpended.\
\
       - Else, append the packet to the requested queue.  Then:\
\

\
\
\
\
\
       - If epoch expires before packet is de-queued for transmission,\
         then charge the source application an amount equal to (epoch\
         duration * packet length * price per unit of time per byte for\
         queue), reduce packet's residual funds by this amount, and\
         start the next epoch; if no more authorized epochs, give up.\
\
       - Else, upon de-queuing the packet for transmission, charge the\
         source application an amount equal to (length of time spent in\
         queue * packet length * price per unit of time per byte for\
         queue) and reduce packet's residual funds by this amount.\
\
\
    *  Transmission classes _ queues _are of varying maximum length\
       (the more expensive queues are shorter) but packets in all\
       transmission classes are at the same level of priority; packets\
       are de-queued in round-robin fashion to ensure that no class is\
       altogether starved for service.  Because First Class is a\
       shorter queue than Business Class, packets that pay for First\
       Class spend less time waiting.\
\
    *  Separately, an Emergency queue is provided for system-critical\
       packets.  Everything in the Emergency queue has higher priority\
       than everything else, so nothing else gets transmitted until the\
       Emergency queue is emptied.\
\
   Periodically, each bundle protocol agent reports aggregate charge\
   amounts back to the source applications and also to some central\
   accounting authority ["the bank", nominally based on Earth]; this is\
   a separate application-layer protocol.  When the central authority\
   determines that a source application is out of funds, it reports the\
   source application's bankruptcy to all bundle agents; from that time\
   on, all service requests and packets received from that source\
   application are rejected.\
\
   Although this particular scheme may ultimately prove too complex to\
   be workable, we think the general principle of fine-grained bandwidth\
   allocation could contribute significantly to the viability of the\
   IPN.\
\
4. IPN Nodes\
\
   Nodes within the IPN have a number of responsibilities.  As members\
   in a store-and-forward chain, they have the responsibility for\
   resource allocation to support bundle transfers.  These resources\
   include, among other things, buffer space and transmission capacity.\
\
   Additionally, IPN nodes have the responsibility of actually executing\
   the bundle transfer.  Reliability requirements for bundle transfers\
   are specified by the using application, and include both reliable and\
   unreliable transfers (possibly with some intermediate, or partial,\
\
Cerf, et al.             Expires November 2001                 [Page 23]\
 \
Internet Draft       draft-irtf-ipnrg-arch-00.txt        May 2001\
\
\
\
   reliability services).  The IPN nodes are responsible for using\
   whatever reliability mechanisms exist in the underlying (transport-\
   and-below) layers, and augmenting those mechanisms as necessary to\
   effect the required reliability.\
\
   Finally, IPN nodes are responsible for routing bundles between IPN\
   domains.  IPN nodes may depend upon the services of the local\
   internets (or the IPN backbone) for intra-domain routing.\
\
   In this section, we first briefly state the types of IPN nodes that\
   we have identified, and then we provide a number of exemplary end-to-\
   end data transfer descriptions.  Finally, we list the error\
   conditions that we have identified that may occur at the bundle layer\
   during the course of end-to-end data transfer.\
\
4.1.   Types of IPN Nodes\
\
   We identify three grades of IPN functional capability.  In order of\
   increasing scope, they are: agent capability, relay capability, and\
   gateway capability.  All IPN nodes are able to act as bundle agents;\
   some bundle agents are additionally able to act as IPN relays; some\
   IPN relays are additionally able to act as IPN gateways.\
\
   * Bundle agents build and consume bundles.  These could be stand-\
     alone proxy devices or could be an operating system service\
     collocated with an application.  The endpoints of an end-to-end\
     bundle transmission need not be any more than bundle agents,\
     though they may additionally have relay or even gateway\
     capability.\
\
   * IPN Relays receive bundles and forward them toward their\
     destinations, either within or between IPN regions.\
\
   * IPN Gateways reside at the interface between IPN regions.  The IPN\
     gateways perform routing between the IPN regions.\
\
   Orthogonal to these grades of capability is the ability to take\
   custody of a bundle.  The endpoints of a bundle transaction are\
   typically the initial and final custodians of the bundle.  Non-\
   gateway relays may take custody of the bundles they receive;\
   alternatively, they may simply provide mitigation of R2 effects\
   (signal strength losses due to the extreme distances of\
   interplanetary communication), but provide no custody transfer\
   capabilities.  (In the latter case they are essentially "repeaters.")\
   Gateways normally take custody but are not required to do so.\
\
4.2.   Example end-to-end transfer\
\
   We provide the following example of an end-to-end transfer that\
   crosses multiple IPN Regions:  A host on Earth sends a bundle to a\
   destination on Mars.  Figure 2 illustrates the network that is the\
   subject of this example _ the Interplanetary Internet in this example\

   has five distinct regions interconnected by four IPN Gateways.  This\
   example highlights the actions taken by the bundle layer and the\
   interactions of the bundle layer with applications and with\
   underlying transport protocols.\
\
4.2.1. Backbone connectivity\
\
   It is important to have some understanding of the routing that is\
   required at the IPN Gateways.  Unlike terrestrial communications, the\
   IPN's long-haul communication links are directional, mobile, and\
   highly scheduled.  This is important, because directionality combined\
   with mobility means that a transmitter and receiver must track each\

   other in order to establish and maintain a communication link.  In\
   the IPN, much of the mobility is due to orbital mechanics and is\
   therefore relatively predictable.  However, this means that nodes\
   that we would normally consider to be fixed, such as antennas on the\
   surface of the Earth, are actually highly mobile as a result of the\
   Earth's rotation and its revolution around the Sun.  (In this\
   example, we confine ourselves to our local solar system, and do not\
   consider the motion of our sun relative to celestial bodies outside\
   our solar system.)  We can describe the predictable aspects of node\
   mobility with an ephemeris, a table of the positions of celestial\
   bodies at specified intervals of time.  Both a directional sender and\
   receiver must know the other's position in order to establish a link\
   between the pair.  In addition, these communication resources are\
   highly scheduled.  It is not sufficient for a receiver to point at a\

\
   prospective target and just wait _ for example, a terrestrial node\
   will typically have to point at several targets sequentially, and an\
   interplanetary node will typically not have enough power to just wait\
   for incoming messages.  Rather, a schedule of communication\
   opportunities must be calculated and then refined with planned\
   communication instances.  A communication opportunity establishes\
   that the endpoints could establish a link if they were pointing at\
   each other at the proper times.  We refer to a planned communication\
   instance as an agreement (although not irrevocable) between the two\
   parties to establish contact and communicate for a defined period of\
   time.  The protocols for establishing the schedule of communication\
   instances between all pairs of possible communicants will evolve --\
   from something primarily done manually to something more automated as\
   the Interplanetary Internet grows.\
\
   The scheduled nature of connectivity in the Interplanetary Internet,\
   particularly across the deep-space links, means that at the time of a\
   bundle's arrival at an IPN Gateway, some or all of the possible\
   outbound routes may be "down."  The gateway must store the bundle\
   until the appropriate link is available and then transmit the bundle\
   over that link.  One of the fundamental differences between the\
   Interplanetary Internet and the terrestrial Internet is this inherent\
   use of store-and-forward mechanisms in routing bundles.   With that\
   in mind, let us consider the routing decisions made at some of the\
   IPN Gateways in Figure 2.\
\
4.2.2. IPN Gateway routing\
\
   Bundle routing at an IPN gateway will typically have to deal with a\
   mix of continuously available links and intermittently available\
   links. Routing across a continuously available link is a relatively\
   straightforward activity.  Routing in the presence of intermittently\
   available links can be significantly more complex, as the gateway\
   will need to decide not only the next hop destination but also the\
   time at which to send the bundle.  Conditions elsewhere in the\
   network may make it more desirable to send a bundle to a next-hop\
   destination that is not yet accessible, even when an alternative\
   route is currently available.  The routing function in IPN Gateways\
   and other IPN nodes that have intermittent links has three distinct\
   parts:  the contact scheduler, the route evaluation algorithm, and\
   the dispatcher algorithm.\
\
   Figure 3 illustrates the relationship of these functions with each\
   other and with other elements of the communication protocol suite.\
   The contact scheduling application establishes the schedule for\
   communicating with next-hop neighbors.  The implications of this\
   scheduling activity are broad _ orbital mechanics, resource\
   management onboard the spacecraft, prospective communications loads,\
   and so forth all play a role.  Because spacecraft resources must be\
   coordinated among all functions (not just communications), this is\
   typically going to be part of a larger resource management\
   application (interactions with functions such as pointing and power\

\
   control are not shown in Figure 3, but are present nonetheless).  It\
   is very likely that the contact scheduler will *not* be local to the\
   bundle node, but rather a centralized function that distributes a\
   contact schedule to IPN nodes that perform routing.  This may change\
   in the future to a distributed contact scheduling algorithm, but for\
   the foreseeable future, this will not be the case.  The product of\
   the contact scheduler is a schedule of planned contacts, durations,\
   expected data rates, etc.  It is intrinsically link-state in nature.\

   The route evaluation application exchanges information with all\
   first-hop neighbors (we hope this occurs infrequently) to build a\
   general picture of the IPN beyond the first-hop neighbors.  We\
   currently view this in terms of a distance-vector representation, but\
   with metrics such as the expected delay to the destination IPN region\
   and average aggregate data rate to the destination IPN region.  The\
   mechanics for building these metrics are still in development.\

\
\
   The dispatcher algorithms accepts routing requests from the bundle\
   transport layer and builds a "manifest" for each next-hop contact\
   that is subsequently consumed by the bundle routing layer.  The\
   dispatcher application consumes some or all of the following in\
   deciding how to schedule bundle transmissions:  the contact schedule,\
   the routing information, local policy information, and the per-bundle\
   specifics provided by the bundle transport layer (such as bundle\
   destination, length, priority, time-to-live, and possibly\
   "Starbucks"-related information).  We envision a family of different\
   dispatcher algorithms, operating as "plug-ins," that provide\
   different levels of sophistication in the scheduling function to suit\
   different needs.  The simplest versions of the dispatcher might just\
   consider destination to schedule the bundle on the soonest-possible\
   outbound contact.  More sophisticated versions might consider\
   priority, bundle length (to preserve atomicity), and time-to-live\
   requirements.  Others could support the Starbucks model or apply\
   optimization techniques to attempt to improve the use of each\
   contact.\
\
   The following is a conceptual description of what happens:  when a\
   bundle arrives at the bundle layer and needs to be routed, the bundle\
   routing function posts a request to the dispatcher, noting the\
   destination, length, priority, time to live, etc. of the bundle to be\
   routed.  The dispatcher integrates this bundle into its manifest and,\
   at the bundle's transmission time, informs the bundle routing\
   function to send the bundle to the appropriate next-hop destination.\

   equivalents in the terrestrial Internet (DNS 1), in the IPN\

4.2.4. Step 1:  Bundle creation and first-hop transmission\
\
   An application on the source host in Figure 4 has data that it wishes\
   to send to the destination on Mars.  The exact content of this data\
   is opaque to the bundle transfer, but assume that it contains all of\
   the information necessary to accomplish some desired function.  That\
   is, assume that application-specific instructions for storage,\
   handling, error processing, and disposal accompany whatever data\
   object is to be operated upon.  The application invokes the bundle\
   agent, supplying it the information shown in Table 2.\

\
   The bundle agent creates a bundle and stores it in persistent storage\
   (on disk or other non-volatile memory).  There are some fields of the\
   bundle header that the bundle agent must supply:  the Bundle\
   Identifier, the Source Host name tuple, the Custodian name tuple, and\
   the time to live.  (The application may state a time after which the\
   data are obsolete, but the actual time-to-live field in the bundle\
   header uses the application's data in combination with network\
   restrictions on time-to-live to initialize this field properly.)  The\
   bundle agent's routing function requests a route from the dispatcher\
   application, and receives next-hop destination information and source\
   information.  (Since a host may reside in multiple IPN Regions, the\
   source host name tuple is a function of the outbound route selected.\
\
Cerf, et al.             Expires November 2001                 [Page 30]\
 \
Internet Draft       draft-irtf-ipnrg-arch-00.txt        May 2001\
\
\
\
   The bundle agent uses this information to complete the Source Host\
   and Custodian name tuples prior to transmission.)\
\
   Note:  For hosts that have continuously available communication\
   resources, it is likely that an optimization would be implemented to\
   reduce the required interaction with the dispatcher application.  In\
   this instance, the bundle routing function might consult a local\
   routing table before contacting the dispatcher, and only requesting\
   routing information from the dispatcher if there is no appropriate\
   entry in the routing table.\
\
   The bundle in this example is destined for the "mars.sol" IPN Region\
   (per Table 1).  The dispatcher (or routing table) determines that the\
   proper next-hop destination for the mars.sol region is\
   \{ipngw1.jpl.nasa.gov, earth.sol\}, and that the appropriate transport\
   protocol to use is TCP.  The bundle agent consults the Terrestrial\
   Domain Name Server to resolve ipngw1.jpl.nasa.gov to an IP address,\
   establishes a TCP connection with ipngw1, and transfers the bundle to\
   it.  The bundle agent at the source retains a custodial copy of the\
   bundle in persistent storage.\
\
\
4.2.5. Step 2:  Bundle processing at first-hop destination\
\
   When the IPN Gateway \{ipngw1.jpl.nasa.gov, earth.sol\} receives the\
   bundle via TCP, it stores it on persistent storage (disk).  The\
   bundle agent consults the dispatcher, and is informed that the\
   appropriate next-hop destination is in the "ipn.sol" IPN Region:\
   \{ipngw2.nasa.mars.org, ipn.sol\}.  The dispatcher provides the time at\
   which the bundle should be transmitted, at which time the contact\
   scheduler and its associated functionality will ensure that there is\
   a contact with ipngw2 via the Long Haul Transport Protocol (LTP).  In\
   considering alternative contacts for the bundle, the dispatcher\
   checks the time-to-live in the bundle, which was 36 hours from the\
   time of initial submission to the bundle agent at the source, to\
   ensure that the route selected is consistent with the time-to-live\
   requirements of the bundle.  The bundle transport functionality of\
   the bundle agent in ipngw1 accepts custody of the bundle, updates\
   this information in the bundle header, and informs the source that\
   has done so.  The sources bundle agent deletes its custodial copy of\
   the bundle.  When the time indicated by the dispatching function\
   arrives, the bundle is transmitted via LTP to the IPN Gateway that\
   connects the ipn.sol Region with the mars.sol Region:\
   \{ipngw2.nasa.mars.org, ipn.sol\}.\
\
4.2.6. Step 3:  Bundle processing at gateway to destination IPN Region\
\
   The Mars gateway, \{ipngw2.nasa.mars.org, mars.sol\}, receives the\
   bundle from the Earth gateway via LTP.  It stores the bundle in\
   persistent storage and accepts custody of the bundle, signaling back\
   to the Earth gateway that it has done so.  When the notification of\
   acceptance reaches the Earth gateway, ipngw1 deletes its custodial\

 \

\
\
\
   copy.  The Mars gateway consults its dispatcher application to find\
   an outbound contact to forward the bundle over.  The dispatcher\
   returns an indication that the appropriate next hop is the\
   destination itself, that the proper transport protocol is TCP, and\
   that the destination is accessible immediately.  The gateway verifies\
   that the time-to-live has not expired, and forwards the bundle to the\
   destination.\
\
4.2.7. Step 4:  Bundle processing at destination\
\
   The destination bundle agent receives the bundle via TCP, stores it\
   on its own persistent storage, and accepts custody of the bundle from\
   IPN G/W2.  The bundle agent "awakens" the destination application\
   process identified by the Destination Application Instance Handle.\
   This may involve creating a new instance of a server from a daemon\
   process, signaling an idle running process, or reinstantiating a\
   process that has been suspended with its state stored on persistent\
   storage.  (The specifics of this are system-dependent, and may have\
   to be robust against system restarts, upgrades, and migration of\
   processes from one host to another.)  The bundle agent deletes the\
   copy of the bundle from persistent storage when the application has\
   received it.  The destination application may generate an\
   application-layer acknowledgment in a new bundle and send it to the\
   source's application instance identifier (0x1763421A from Table 2).\
\
4.3.   Error Conditions at the Bundle Layer\
\
   This section describes the error conditions that may arise at the\
   bundle layer during bundle creation and transport.  When these errors\
   occur within the sender's IPN domain, it may be possible to conduct a\
   near-real-time dialog to correct them before the bundle is forwarded.\
   We say `may be possible' because even if two nodes are in the same\
   IPN domain, they may not have real-time connectivity.  An example of\
   such a situation would be if a lander were on the opposite side of\
   the planet from its IPN gateway, and used bundles to communicate with\
   the gateway through a low altitude orbiter, with the orbiter itself\
   serving as a bundle agent.\

\
   The errors that can occur at the bundle layer are shown in Table 3.\
   Error numbers marked with an asterisk (*) are reported back to the\
   sending application.\
\
   * Unknown Destination Region: This error occurs when the source\
     bundle agent is directed to create a bundle destined for an IPN\
     Region that is not recognized (i.e. one for which there is no\
     applicable route known to the Dispatcher Application).  Note that\
     only the IPN Region part of the destination name has to be\
     interpretable outside the destination's IPN Region.  In\
     particular, the administrative part of the destination name need\
     not be interpretable to the source DNS (assuming the source and\
     destination are in different IPN Regions), so it cannot\
     necessarily be checked when the bundle is created.\
\
   * Invalid Source Application: If the source application instance\
     handle supplied by the source application is invalid, the source\
\

\
\
\
     bundle agent responds with an Invalid Source Application error.\
     This might be the case, for instance, if the source application\
     provided an instance handle referencing a system process for which\
     the application didn't have privileges.\
\
   * Bundle Parameter Syntax Error: The source bundle agent may check\
     the syntax of some of the bundle-creation parameters (i.e. it may\
     ensure that the end-to-end and IPN access security certificates\
     are well-formed, etc.)  If a parameter is found to be\
     syntactically incorrect or obviously and definitely erroneous, the\
     bundle agent will report a Bundle Parameter Syntax Error back to\
     the source that includes, at a minimum, the parameter that caused\
     the error.\
\
   * Bundle Parameter Semantic Error: If the source bundle agent can\
     identify a particular bundle creation parameter as being well-\
     formed but unserviceable, it will report a Bundle Parameter\
     Semantic Error to the source application that includes, at a\
     minimum, the parameter that caused the error.\
\
   * Invalid Node Name in LSRR/SSRR: If an invalid node name is\
     discovered in the loose or strict source route & record, the\
     bundle agent that detects the error will propagate it back to the\
     source application.  Note that it may be advantageous to have\
     bundle agents check the validity not only of the next hop in the\
     source route but as many entries as they can.  The value of\
     checking multiple entries would be in detecting errors as soon as\
     possible, preferably before the bundle traversed any of the long-\
     haul links.\
\
   * Insufficient Buffer Space: If a bundle agent does not have\
     sufficient buffer space to accept a bundle, it drops the bundle\
     and generates an Insufficient Buffer Space error.  Note that a\
     bundle node may choose to drop lower priority bundles in order to\
     make room for higher priority ones. This error is not propagated\
     back to the source.\
\
   * DNS Unreachable: If a bundle agent needs access to its DNS (or\
     DNS-equivalent) and cannot obtain information from it, it\
     generates a DNS Unreachable error.  This information is not\
     propagated back to the source application.\
\
   * Time Exceeded: If the time-to-live field (either the source-\
     provided TTL or the internal bundle TTL) expires, the source is\
     notified with a Time Exceeded message.  These errors are\
     propagated to the source application.\
\
   * Source Entity Access Denied: This error indicates that the source\
     entity does not have access to a needed resource at an IPN node.\
     The source might not be authorized to use the node at all, or it\
     might not have authorization to use a particular interface\
     required by the bundle.  Source Entity Access Denied errors\
\

 \
Internet Draft       draft-irtf-ipnrg-arch-00.txt        May 2001\
\
\
\
     indicate that the source is not authorized to use a particular\
     resource; other errors (e.g. Insufficient Buffer Space) indicate\
     that a particular resource is unavailable to a bundle.  For\
     example, an entity on the surface of a planet might be authorized\
     to communicate, using the bundle protocol, with another entity on\
     the other side of the planet via a low-altitude orbiter that is\
     also an IPN gateway.  The sender might not, however, be authorized\
     to send bundles across interplanetary space.  In this case bundles\
     sent to the orbiter destined for the other side of the planet\
     would not cause errors, while any bundles with off-planet\
     destination addresses would.  Source Entity Access Denied errors\
     are propagated back to the source application.\
\
   * Invalid Administrative Destination Name: Once a bundle has reached\
     its destination IPN Region, the administrative part of the\
     destination name can be verified.  If the administrative part of\
     the destination name is not valid, the source is notified with an\
     Invalid Administrative Destination Name error message.  As with\
     LSRR/SSRR, it would probably be advantageous to check the\
     administrative part of the destination name as soon as possible to\
     avoid propagating misnamed bundles and error messages across the\
     backbone.\
\
   * Invalid Destination Application: If the destination bundle agent\
     cannot instantiate the destination application (based on the\
     destination application instance handle in the bundle), it\
     notifies the source application with an Invalid Destination\
     Application error message.\
\
   * End-to-End Access Denied: If the bundle destination does not\
     accept the bundle due to an authentication or access-control\
     error, the source is notified with an End-to-End Access Denied\
     Message.\
\
4.4.   Support of existing Internet applications\
\
   There is no clean way to support "legacy" applications in the IPN.\
   One might think that application-layer proxies could protect\
   applications from the rigors of interplanetary communications, but it\
   turns out that this is not the case, even if the appropriate timers\
   (at both application and transport layers) could be scaled correctly.\
   As an example, consider a legacy FTP client on Earth trying to get a\
   file from an FTP server on Mars.  If the client's connection request\
   to \{foo.bar.com, mars.sol\} is somehow coerced into binding to an\
   Earth-resident application proxy (as can be done with nonstandard\
   modifications to the terrestrial DNS) the proxy then has to negotiate\
   enough information out of the client to form the bundle that will\
   travel to Mars.  This bundle needs to include at least:\
   * The client's IPN domain name\

   of the `quote' command, there is no guarantee that other clients\
   (specifically GUI clients) will be able to accomplish this.  SMTP (e-\
   mail) is perhaps the only application that could possibly be tuned to\
   work over interplanetary distances, but even SMTP has embedded timers\
   that would have to be altered significantly before it would work.\
\
5. Security in the IPN\
\
   We do not have a detailed list of security requirements for the\
   Interplanetary Internet, primarily because there currently aren't any\
   "users" of the IPN and few, if any, of the potential users have given\
   enough thought to security to commit to a set of security\
   "requirements".  However, we know that the Interplanetary Internet's\
   bandwidth resources will be precious. We can also safely assume that\
   the IPN will be a prized hacker's target (at least from Earth).  We\
   can also envision that there will be precious, private data flowing\
   across the IPN.  As a result, we assume that various security\
   mechanisms and services will be required to provide protection for\
   the bundles traversing the IPN and for the IPN infrastructure itself.\
\
   There are two aspects to IPN security: protection of the IPN\
   infrastructure and protection of the data traversing the IPN. The\
   protection of the IPN infrastructure is not unlike the protection\
   required for the Earth-based Internet infrastructure.  There will be\
   a need to exchange routing information securely among the IPN nodes\
   as well as to securely manage them.  For the IPN infrastructure to\
   protect itself, the IPN nodes need to be mutually suspicious of one\
   another.  That is, the IPN nodes will authenticate themselves to each\
   other to ensure that they are not being spoofed by an untrustworthy\
   entity.  One might ask if this is overkill if we believe that there\
   will always be a small, controlled number of IPN nodes (a la the\
   original ARPANET). However, one could equally envision that there\
   could be many IPN nodes that are sponsored and controlled by multiple\
   organizations (a la the current Internet).  Since we would like the\
   IPN to easily scale, we want to build mutual suspicion and security\
   mechanisms into the IPN architecture from the outset. It should be\
   noted that the same mechanisms could be used to provide security for\
   both the IPN infrastructure and the data flowing through it.\
\
5.1.   Assumptions Regarding Required IPN Security Mechanisms\
\
   The security mechanisms assumed to be required for the IPN are:\
   * Access control\
   * Authentication\
\
Cerf, et al.             Expires November 2001                 [Page 36]\
 \
Internet Draft       draft-irtf-ipnrg-arch-00.txt        May 2001\
\
\
\
   * Data integrity\
   * Data privacy\
\
   Access controls will be required because the IPN's space-based assets\
   will have limited resources available and because it will be a likely\
   target from a hacking perspective.  By limiting access to the IPN\
   resources, we limit the availability of the IPN to only those users\
   who require its services and do not allow it to be overburdened by\
   those who are not authorized to access the IPN services.\
\
   Authentication of identity will be required to perform access control\
   mediation.  To allow or disallow access to the IPN, an assured\
   identity of the source of the network traffic will be needed.  The\
   identity might be of an individual (e.g., a payload principal\
   investigator) or a location (e.g., a science payload control center\
   or a spacecraft control center).\
\
   Data integrity will be required to ensure that data received across\
   the IPN is the same data that was originally sent.  This is true from\
   both an IPN infrastructure perspective (e.g., management data) as\
   well as from a user's perspective (e.g., science data, command\
   sequences). Data integrity assures that any unauthorized modification\
   of the data will be detectable by the receiver.\
\
   Data privacy will be required to ensure that only those who are\
   authorized to obtain data traversing the IPN or destined to/from the\
   IPN infrastructure will be able to do so.  This mechanism is also\
   known as confidentiality.\
\
   In the network security community, there are two well-known security\
   paradigms: hop-by-hop security (also known as link security) and end-\
   to-end security.  In the hop-by-hop paradigm, the data to be\
   transmitted over the network is protected on a hop-by-hop basis.\
   That is, the data is protected at its source, but in order to be\
   routed to its final destination, it must be unprotected at a trusted\
   routing point (e.g., a ground-based gateway, an IPN gateway) in order\
   to be examined for onward routing.  The trusted routing point must\
   then re-protect the data and forward it on to its next routing point.\
   Each successive hop point must unprotect and re-protect the data\
   until it reaches its ultimate destination.  A negative aspect of this\
   security paradigm is that, depending on how the protection is\
   applied; the data might be completely exposed while in the gateway\
   (hence the term trusted gateway).  This means that the data is\
   potentially vulnerable to unauthorized modification and unauthorized\
   disclosure.\
\
   The end-to-end paradigm does not employ trusted gateways.  Rather, it\
   assumes that the path between the source of the data and its\
   destination is hostile and cannot be trusted.  As a result, the data\
   is protected at its source and is not unprotected until it reaches\
   its destination.  However, in order for this scheme to work, routing\
   information must remain unprotected so that the intermediate gateways\
\
Cerf, et al.             Expires November 2001                 [Page 37]\
 \
Internet Draft       draft-irtf-ipnrg-arch-00.txt        May 2001\
\
\
\
   are able to determine how to forward the data without having the\
   opportunity to read or change the data.\
\
   One problem with the end-to-end paradigm is that it can only work\
   across a network where there are end-to-end protocols (e.g., TCP).\
   There has to be a protocol below the data that provides the ability\
   to route.  One example of this is the Internet Engineering Task\
   Force's (IETF) Internet Protocol Security Protocol (IPSEC).  The\
   IPSEC Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) protocol provides an end-\
   to-end security service between the IP and TCP protocol layers.\
\
   However, in the IPN, as has already been discussed earlier, IP and\
   TCP are not necessarily carried end-to-end protocols.  Rather, those\
   protocols can/will be terminated in a local internet (e.g. a ground\
   segment on earth or another celestial body) and not carried end-to-\
   end through the IPN.  The data will be carried end-to-end via the\
   bundle protocol that would in turn, be transported by other IPN\
   protocols (e.g., LTP, TCP) using the pony express model.\
\
   Since the IPN must be structured on a store-and-forward basis, and\
   since users may not trust the IPN gateways, solutions such as IPSEC\
   cannot be employed.  In order to provide an end-to-end like security\
   solution, security mechanisms can only be applied to the data and not\
   any other protocol layer(s) below the bundle protocol.  This is the\
   way the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) (now being specified within the\
   IETF as the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol) and secure email\
   techniques such as S/MIME and OpenPGP work.  In essence, security\
   services are only applied to the data portion of a packet, leaving\
   all of the packet's protocol headers in the open and available for\
   use by intermediate systems.  For example, to transmit the string\
   "hello world" across the Internet would entail encapsulating the\
   string into a TCP header, an IP header, and a media access (MAC)\
   layer header.  To provide end-to-end security services, only the\
   payload ("hello world") would have security services applied to it\
   (e.g., it might be encrypted to provide privacy/confidentiality).\
   However the TCP, IP, and MAC headers would all remain without\
   security services applied to them.  In comparison, when using IPSEC\
   ESP, the TCP header would have security services applied to it to\
   protect it as well as the payload data.  And if it were operating in\
   "tunnel" mode, ESP would encapsulate the entire payload - the TCP and\
   IP headers - inside of an IP packet.\
\
   Given that data will be transported across the IPN in bundles using\
   an email-like paradigm, borrowing technology from email security is a\
   solution for the IPN.\
\
5.2.   Secure Email Technology\
\
   Since secure electronic mail operates in a non-interactive mode, and\
   since both communicating parties have not necessarily communicated\
   with one another previously, a technique different than used by IPSEC\
   was developed.  One way in which email could be securely wrapped\
\
Cerf, et al.             Expires November 2001                 [Page 38]\
 \
Internet Draft       draft-irtf-ipnrg-arch-00.txt        May 2001\
\
\
\
   (e.g., encrypted and/or digitally signed) is via through the use of\
   public key cryptography.  Using this technology, an email sender\
   would use the public key of the intended recipient to encrypt the\
   payload (i.e., the message) and the recipient would use its private\
   key to decrypt the payload.  Likewise, the sender could digitally\
   sign the message (in order to authenticate the message) using its\
   private key and the recipient would verify the message's authenticity\
   using the sender's public key.   However, there are two problems with\
   this scheme for the IPN.\
\
   The first problem is that public key cryptography is quite\
   consumptive of processor power.  Therefore, the common practice is to\
   use symmetric key (i.e., shared secret) algorithms for large amounts\
   of data.  With changes in technology, this problem may disappear, at\
   least for earth-based systems.  However, it is not clear that space-\
   based assets will catch up as quickly.  The second problem is that\
   public key cryptography is consumptive of bandwidth.  A public key\
   exchange technology that allows two communicating entities to derive\
   a shared symmetric key by virtue of knowing each other's public keys\
   and exchanging some random information is known as a Diffie-Hellman\
   exchange.  However, the exchange of information must be performed in\
   a near-real-time environment so that the shared key can be used to\
   encrypt transmissions.  This is not practical in the IPN since there\
   are no real-time exchanges of data on an end-to-end basis.\
\
   However, the secure email community has realized that they also\
   operate under a pony-express model. The secure email community has\
   also realized that secure email may be sent to entities with which\
   one has not previously communicated.  Therefore, there needed to be a\
   base-level expectation of a common, minimal set of security services\
   that both sides could use.\
\
   The general technique used by the secure email community is that the\
   sending entity decides what security mechanism(s) to employ (e.g.,\
   encryption for confidentiality, digital signature for authentication\
   and integrity, or both).  If the data to be sent via email is to be\
   encrypted, the sender generates a random key that is used to encrypt\
   the data and the data is encrypted.  The sender then either has in\
   its possession the public key of the receiver, or queries a public\
   key server (e.g., a public key infrastructure or PKI) to obtain the\
   receiver's public key, which would be contained in a digital\
   certificate. At the expense of additional bandwidth, the sender can\
   transmit its digital certificate in the email message, which the\
   receiver can verify as genuine based on the well-known certificate\
   authority's signature on the certificate.  The key used to encrypt\
   the data is encrypted using the public key of the receiver and the\
   message is sent.  The receiver uses its private key to first decrypt\
   the key used to encrypt the message and then uses the decrypted key\
   to decrypt the data.\
\
   When a digital signature is used, the sender calculates a hash of the\
   message using a digest algorithm such as MD5 or the Secure Hash\
\
Cerf, et al.             Expires November 2001                 [Page 39]\
 \
Internet Draft       draft-irtf-ipnrg-arch-00.txt        May 2001\
\
\
\
   Algorithm (SHA-1).  The resulting hash is then encrypted using the\
   sender's private key.  The encrypted hash is sent along with the\
   message data.  The receiver uses its copy of the sender's public key\
   to authenticate the fact that the message was sent by the sender.\
\
5.3.   Application of Secure Email Technology to the IPN\
\
   Given that the IPN and electronic mail share the same operational\
   paradigm, the IPN's notion of "bundle-space" is directly analogous to\
   a secure email MIME body part.  As was previously explained, in\
   secure email the contents of the message are encrypted using a\
   symmetric key.  The actual message contents are "containerized"\
   (which can be analogized to the contents being "bundled") into a MIME\
   body part.  Additional MIME body parts are also attached which would\
   contain the encrypted symmetric key and additional information needed\
   for decryption.\
\
   Therefore, the same security techniques can be applied to the IPN's\
   notion of "bundle-space." It can be seen how bundle payload data\
   carried through the IPN is equivalent to an email message.\
   Therefore, the bundle payload data, like the email message, can have\
   security services applied to it before being sent as a protected\
   entity via bundling across the IPN.\
\
   In essence, the really difficult part of deploying an IPN security\
   solution based on secure email is the problem of deploying a public\
   key infrastructure (PKI) in the IPN. Deploying a PKI on Earth is\
   equally difficult as can be seen by the continuing problems faced in\
   the various PKI pilot programs currently underway.\
\
   On Earth, the problem is how do competing PKIs cross certify public\
   keys and who acts as the root certification authority? (PKI is based\
   on a tree hierarchy where a root certificate authority's public key\
   is well known in order to certify public key certificates).  On\
   Earth, when a user does not have the necessary public keys, the user\
   can go off to a public key certificate server to obtain the needed\
   certificates which contain digitally signed (i.e., certified and\
   authenticated) public keys. In the case of email, the sender can\
   attach its public key certificate as a MIME body part.  The receiver\
   then validates the digital certificate and uses it to obtain the\
   information contained in the message.  Eventually, a cache of digital\
   certificates is formed containing the information needed to securely\
   communicate among a cadre of entities without having to resort to the\
   use of a key/certificate server.\
\
   The IPN, however, will not have the luxury of being able to query on-\
   line PKI certificate servers (at least not in the same sense as is\
   being contemplated on Earth).  The problem is very much analogous to\
   the one with the Domain Name System (DNS).  When a user sends a\
   secured "bundle" to an IPN entity on another celestial body, we would\
   not want the receiver to have to first query a PKI for a public key\
   certificate on Earth to obtain the receiver's public key.  A local\

 \
Internet Draft       draft-irtf-ipnrg-arch-00.txt        May 2001\
\
\
\
   PKI might exist. However there is the issue of the dynamic nature of\
   such a server and the high likelihood that it would quickly drop out\
   of synch.  It would seem reasonable that the public key certificates\
   of the various space-based entities would not change often, but this\
   could not be said about the Earth-based entities.\
\
   An earth-based sender may be able to query a certificate authority to\
   obtain a certificate for an IPN entity not located on earth.\
   However, an IPN entity in space sending a bundle would not be able to\
   perform such a query.  Therefore, it would appear that a set of pre-\
   placed, cached certificates containing the public keys of those IPN\
   entities that are expected to be communicated with would make sense.\
   In addition, an IPN sender should always include its public key\
   certificate as part of the bundled transmission across the IPN as is\
   done using secure email.  This would "cost" us in terms of bandwidth\
   (a typical X.509 public key certificate is about 1K bytes in size but\
   can be larger when certificate chains are included).  However, by\
   including the certificate, we can be assured that the receiver will\
   not have to use any additional bandwidth, or incur any additional\
   delays in making use of the transmitted data.\
\
5.4.   Protecting IPN Data and the IPN Backbone Infrastructure\
\
   The IPN will have few and precious resources.  Therefore, not only\
   the user data flowing across the IPN will require security services -\
   the backbone infrastructure itself will require similar services.  In\
   order for the IPN infrastructure to be self-protecting, it must be\
   built using the paradigm of mutual suspicion.  Mutual suspicion\
   requires each entity of the IPN to not assume that another IPN entity\
   with which it is communicating is a "friendly" entity.  That is, it\
   should not assume that the IPN entity is who it claims to be without\
   a verified means of identification.  Based on a verified identity,\
   access controls can be performed to allow or disallow communications\
   between entities.\
\
   Infrastructure information such as routing updates, node management\
   information, distribution of digital certificates, and certificate\
   revocation lists need to be protected from unauthorized modification\
   and potentially from unauthorized disclosure.  The IPN nodes would\
   use the same mechanisms as are used to provide protection for user\
   data - namely the security services available to a bundle aware\
   application (e.g., a "bundle-agent").\
\
   A bundle aware application would encrypt and/or digitally sign the\
   IPN infrastructure payload to be transmitted to another IPN node.\
   The signed and/or encrypted payload would then be presented to a\
   bundle-agent that would prepare the payload data to be carried across\
   the IPN in a bundle.  Potentially, the bundle-agent might also sign\
   and/or encrypt for hop-by-hop security protection, which would allow\
   each bundle-agent receiving the bundle to authenticate the identity\
   of the transmitting bundle-agent.  This mechanism provides the\
   ability to ensure that no other entity can masquerade as a rogue\

\
\
\
   bundle-agent.\
\
   The bundle-agent residing at a ground-based IPN gateway should check\
   the signature of the bundle payload to perform an access control\
   check to limit access to the IPN only to those who are authorized to\
   use it.  The access control check can be accomplished via an access\
   control list.\
\
   Finally, the receiving application would make the final security\
   checks before accepting the data payload from the final receiving\
   bundle-agent.  Should all the final checks succeed, the receiving\
   application would then be free to consume the data.\
\
6. Building a Stable Backbone for the IPN\
\
   Just as the performance and capability of the terrestrial Internet\
   are largely determined by the capacity and stability of its backbone\
   links, so will the performance and capability of the Interplanetary\
   Internet depend in large part on the capacity and stability of the\
   interplanetary backbone.\
\
   By "backbone" we mean a set of high-capacity, high-availability links\
   between points of access to high-activity subnets.  In the\
   terrestrial Internet, backbone links are typically between the high-\
   activity subnets for cities such as Houston and Chicago.  In the\
   Interplanetary Internet the backbone links will be between the high-\
   activity "subnets" for planets such as Earth and Mars.\
\
   But the IPN backbone will differ from familiar terrestrial backbones\
   in several important ways.\
\
   * The media by which information is transmitted obviously differ.\
     Terrestrial backbone links used to be copper wire and are now\
     optical fiber.  In the Interplanetary Internet, all information\
     will be via radiation _ either RF or optical _ through empty\
     space.\
   * The nature of the connectivity between backbone points of presence\
     (POPs) will be fundamentally different.  Terrestrial Internet\
     connectivity is structural and relatively static: nodes are\
     physically attached to fiber.  Interplanetary Internet\
     connectivity will be operational, directed, and highly dynamic:\
     radiation must be directed at the right moment toward nodes that\
     are prepared to detect it, and the transmitting and receiving\
     entities will be in continuous movement relative to one another.\
   * The costs of deploying, repairing, and upgrading infrastructure\
     will be much higher for the interplanetary backbone than for\
     terrestrial backbones.\
   * The costs of configuring, operating, and managing the\
     interplanetary backbone will likely be somewhat higher than for\
     terrestrial backbones.  One factor in this is the scarcity and\
     high cost of electrical power at IPN nodes deployed off Earth.\
   * Perhaps most important of all, the distances between nodes of the\
\
Cerf, et al.             Expires November 2001                 [Page 42]\
 \
Internet Draft       draft-irtf-ipnrg-arch-00.txt        May 2001\
\
\
\
     interplanetary backbone will be vastly greater than the distances\
     between nodes of terrestrial backbones _ so great that the speed\
     of light becomes a very significant constraint on backbone\
     operations.\
\
6.1.   Backbone Design Considerations\
\
   The differences described above imply two general constraints on the\
   design of the interplanetary backbone.\
\
   1.\
     Bandwidth is not free, or even cheap.  Reliable delivery cost per\
     bit will be far higher across the interplanetary backbone than\
     across any terrestrial backbone, so bandwidth must be thoughtfully\
     allocated.  Both retransmission and forward error correction\
     coding contribute to reliable delivery, but both cost bandwidth;\
     we must seek a balance between the two that minimizes overall\
     overhead.\
   2.\
     Interactive protocols don't work, at least not well.  Negotiation\
     _ connection establishment, flow control, congestion control _ can\
     easily take so long as to consume all available transmission time.\
     Reliable, in-order stream delivery can be so severely delayed by\
     retransmission latency as to be operationally useless.\
\
   These design constraints, in turn, must be accommodated at four\
   layers of the protocol stack.\
\
   At the physical layer, the relevant research is in radiant RF or\
   optical communication.  The physical infrastructure of the\
   interplanetary backbone consists mainly of antennae, many of them\
   mounted aboard orbiting or landed spacecraft, rather than cable in\
   buried or undersea conduit.  In the near to medium term, the\
   principal elements of this infrastructure will be Earth-based\
   tracking stations, such as NASA's Deep Space Network, and the planned\
   "Marsnet" of low-Mars orbiters plus a possible areostationary relay\
   satellite.  In the long term these assets might be augmented by\
   optical communication satellites orbiting Earth and/or other\
   planetary bodies, and perhaps by additional relay satellites\
   positioned at the LaGrange points of planetary orbits (possibly using\
   solar sailing technology for autonomous station-keeping).\
\
   Although this infrastructure will not be subject to some of the\
   problems of terrestrial backbones _ for example, we needn't worry\
   about backhoes cutting through underground fiber _ there will be\
   other challenging operational issues.  Accuracy in pointing and\
   transmission scheduling at the backbone antennae will be critical to\
   assuring the most efficient use of these assets.  This means that all\
   elements of the interplanetary backbone infrastructure must share a\
   common understanding of (a) one another's orbital dynamics and (b)\
   the current time.  The latter argues for the importance of reliable\
   space-borne clocks, together with a protocol for frequent correction\
   of clock drift based on current navigation data.\
\
\
Cerf, et al.             Expires November 2001                 [Page 43]\
 \
Internet Draft       draft-irtf-ipnrg-arch-00.txt        May 2001\
\
\
\
   Moreover, there will be times at which connectivity between a given\
   pair of backbone antennae will be impossible due to the interposition\
   of large, radiant planetary bodies _ or worse, the sun.  These\
   occultations will be predictable, given good models of orbital\
   dynamics, but will nonetheless necessarily constrain the manner in\
   which data flow through the backbone.\
\
   At the link layer, the design issues are somewhat less exotic.  The\
   interplanetary backbone will require link protocols that minimize\
   overhead and that have no inherent expectations of low noise or low\
   point-to-point transmission latency.  CCSDS protocol standards such\
   as Proximity-1 are plausible candidates. They support robust encoding\
   to reduce bit error rates, at some cost in bandwidth consumption.\
\
   Our current thinking is that no interplanetary backbone functionality\
   will be required at the network layer.  The reason for this is that\
   we expect the endpoints of transport-layer protocol on the backbone\
   to be in direct line-of-sight contact as discussed below; since there\
   will be no intervening nodes to route through, there will be no need\
   for routing functionality at the network layer.  [Selection of\
   endpoints for point-to-point transport-layer communication does\
   indeed imply the need for routing and network functionality, but this\
   requirement is addressed at the Bundling layer above Transport.]\
\
   Finally, the general constraints on the design of the interplanetary\
   backbone mandate constraints on the protocol used at the transport\
   layer.  The TCP transport protocol used in both the backbones and the\
   subnets of the terrestrial Internet _ and of other planetary subnets\
   of the IPN _ will not be suitable: connection negotiation and in-\
   order stream delivery are incompatible with the enormous distances\
   between nodes of the interplanetary backbone.\
\
   As noted earlier, the bundle protocol residing just above the\
   transport layer is by nature relatively optimistic about transmission\
   success but it must have transport-layer-like properties, i.e., it\
   must be able to recover from transmission failure at lower layers.\

   retransmission has to be built into it.\
\
   However, the bundle protocol's structural optimism would result in\
   poor performance if such a capacity were exercised frequently.  That\
   optimism has to be justified by the general trustworthiness of lower\
   layers:\
\
   * When the bundle protocol runs over TCP in a deployed internet,\
     TCP's own retransmission regime automatically recovers from errors\
     in the network and link layers, and only a failure in TCP itself\
     will trigger retransmission at the bundle layer.\
\
   * When the bundle protocol is operating over interplanetary\
     distances, a similar level of trustworthiness must be provided by\
     a new interplanetary transport protocol.\

\
\
\
\
   This protocol will necessarily be very different in operation from\
   TCP.  For example, connection time within the interplanetary backbone\
   will be too rare and valuable to squander in waiting for reciprocal\
   traffic of any kind.  Consequently the basic mode of operation in the\
   interplanetary transport protocol will be asynchronous: data will be\
   issued continuously throughout each episode of connectivity, with\
   return traffic _ acknowledgements and coordination messages _ matched\
   up to the corresponding original data as it arrives.  Data will\
   arrive at the final destination out of order (because retransmitted\
   data will arrive late); in many cases, even out-of-order delivery to\
   applications maybe preferable to waiting the minutes, hours, or even\
   days required for complete, error-free acquisition of data.\
\
   Fortunately, out-of-order delivery due to retransmission delay may be\
   made relatively rare by forward error correction at the link layer.\
   Only a failure in that error correction need trigger retransmission\
   at the transport layer.\
\
   Accurate timeout detection will be critical to the success of this\
   retransmission regime.  Premature timeouts would result in\
   unnecessary retransmission, consuming precious bandwidth and\
   degrading link utilization; late detection of timeouts would delay\
   both bundle delivery and the recovery of retransmission processing\
   and storage resources.  We believe interplanetary transmission\
   timeouts can be detected accurately, but only when round-trip times\
   can be calculated from firm operational data rather than estimated\
   from past experience: the extreme variability in round-trip time\
   introduced by intermittent connectivity means that the total round-\
   trip time for transmission N might be hundreds of times greater than\
   that for transmission N _ 1.  The required operational data could in\
   theory be provided regardless of the topological relationship between\
   the Transport-layer endpoints, but we believe support for any model\
   other than point-to-point, direct line-of-sight transmission between\
   the endpoints will not scale.  [Note that accurate clock\
   synchronization across the interplanetary backbone is as important\
   for implementation of timeouts at the transport layer as it is for\
   resource scheduling at the physical layer.]\
\
   Any number of blocks of transport-layer data traffic might\
   concurrently be in various stages of transmission and retransmission,\
   so the aggregate storage space allocated to transmission state data\
   and retransmission buffers might be very large.  Moreover, loss of\
   this information due to (for example) an unplanned power cycle could\
   abort any number of transmissions _ unlike an unplanned reboot of a\
   TCP host, which will crash only the messages that are currently being\
   transmitted on all open streams.  For these reasons, it may well be\
   desirable to retain interplanetary transport protocol data in non-\
   volatile storage rather than dynamic memory.\
\
   In some cases a set of transport protocol agents _ e.g., the set of\
   relay satellites orbiting a planet _ may be most useful if they can\

\
\
   operate in concert as a single "aggregate" entity.  By distributing\
   the retransmission workload across multiple agents as they\
   successively acquire connectivity to a common peer agent, this\
   collective behavior might reduce the total elapsed time required to\
   effect reliable completion of a large block.  If so, we'll\
   additionally need some sort of application-layer coordination\
   protocol operating among the members of this aggregate entity.\
\
   Flow control and congestion control are possibly the least tractable\
   interplanetary backbone design issues at the transport layer.  TCP's\
   strategies are based on reciprocal message exchange that the large\
   delays in interplanetary communication make generally impractical.\
   Alternative approaches remain to be discovered.\
\
7. Deployed Internets in the IPN\
\
   We differentiate between two types of networks in the IPN: the long\
   haul backbone and deployed internets.  The long haul backbone,\
   described in the previous section, is characterized by long\
   propagation times, due to the great physical separation among the\
   communicating elements.  Its protocols are designed to operate\
   efficiently in long-delay, intermittent-connectivity environments.\
   As discussed in [ref: Why not TCP], as delays increase, the\
   efficiency of the Internet suite steadily decreases until\
   applications fail altogether due to embedded time outs.\
\
   We designate a network to be a "deployed internet" if it meets the\
   following criteria:\
\
   * It has connectivity to an interplanetary gateway, and through that\
     gateway can reach the interplanetary backbone or other deployed\
     networks.\
   * It has a communication environment that doesn't inherently\
     preclude the use of (possibly enhanced) internet protocols.\
   * It uses the Domain Name space as a common means of referencing\
     objects and systems across deployed internets.\
\
   This designation covers a wide range of possible configurations.  The\
   following list provides examples of deployed internets:\
\
   * A single lander that hosts an interplanetary gateway and a (real\
     or virtual) lander-internal network;\
   * A small number of cooperating robots on a planetary surface, such\
     as a single lander and a single rover;\
   * An orbiter, a lander, and a sample-return vehicle communicating\
     among themselves and via interplanetary gateways hosted in the\
     orbiter and/or the lander;\
   * Multiple "cells" of robots on a planet surface communicating\
     beyond line of sight via low-orbiting satellites that serve as\
     relays and as interplanetary gateways;\
   * Similar scenarios as above, but with one or more planet-stationary\
     satellites serving as interplanetary gateways;\

\
\
\
   * Spacecraft-onboard networks that communicate with remote endpoints\
     via interplanetary gateways;\
   * The earth's Internet is the initial instantiation of a "deployed\
     internet."\
\
7.1.   Applications of deployed internets in the IPN\
\
   It is appropriate to consider the types of activities that will\
   exercise the deployed internets.  Clearly, we do not yet know all of\
   the types of applications that will be used in deployed internets,\
   but we do have a basic idea of some of the types of applications that\
   will be used in the relatively near term.  In developing this notion\
   of applications within deployed internets, we want to eventually\
   develop the ability to characterize their use of the IPN in terms of\
   arrival rates, data volume, latency and reliability requirements,\
   number and location of producers, number and location of consumers\
   (within the IPN), etc.  At this moment, we have only highly\
   qualitative notions of these kinds of data.  Over time, we will\
   develop a more quantitative representation of this traffic as an\
   adjunct for testing.  The model that we develop will probably never\
   accurately reflect the actual use of the IPN, because the use of the\
   IPN will be affected by its availability:  users will adapt their\
   usage patterns as their understanding of the network's capabilities\
   develops.  We don't ever expect to hit this moving target, but we\
   hope to come close enough to discover most of the usage-related\
   issues that might exist.\
\
   One of the primary uses of a deployed internet is to return science\
   data from the point where it is collected to the point where it will\
   be processed.  The processing point could be on a remote internet\
   (say, on earth) or at some point in the local deployed internet.\
   Depending on the resource availability at the gathering site versus\
   the availability at the processing point, the transfer could be\
   largely unprocessed data, shipped as a formatted stream or as a file.\
   Alternatively, the data could be processed to reduce its transmission\
   size, which would likely result in a file transfer operation.  Sizes,\
   frequency, precise reliability requirements, and so forth remain to\
   be determined.  However, in general, this data is not particularly\
   time-sensitive (although the equipment may be quite sensitive to the\
   amount of time that it takes to complete a transfer due to power\
   considerations, which will be discussed later).\
\
   Another primary application, the reporting of health and status\
   telemetry, is typically accomplished via repetitive, unreliable\
   transmission in today's spacecraft.  There is underway a slow\
   evolution toward data-summarization on board spacecraft.  But there\
   is, understandably, some resistance to filtering or summarizing data\
   at the spacecraft, since in the event of a spacecraft catastrophe,\
   data not previously transmitted is not available for post-mortem\
   analysis.  An important aspect of current telemetry systems is its\
   delivery characteristics, which are either "stream-oriented" or\
   periodically delivered.  Mission operators perceive that "heartbeat"-\
\
Cerf, et al.             Expires November 2001                 [Page 47]\
 \
Internet Draft       draft-irtf-ipnrg-arch-00.txt        May 2001\
\
\
\
   style information that is ancillary to a periodic or "continuous"\
   stream of telemetry is an important characteristic that will not\
   displace event-driven telemetry for the foreseeable future.\
\
   A third type of application is the command and control of in-situ\
   elements.  Command and control refers to the closed-loop control of\
   remote systems.  The endpoints of the control loop could be separated\
   by interplanetary space, as in the case of terrestrial commanding of\
   a rover.  Alternatively, the endpoints could be in reasonably close\
   proximity, but resident on physically separate platforms connected by\
   wireless media.  This is the case when a lander controls a rover.\
   These types of applications must be designed to accommodate the\
   delays intrinsic in the network, but the network can permit more\
   responsive control operations by providing qualities of service that\
   mitigate those delays.  With command and control applications, data\
   volumes tend to be fairly low, and the commands tend to be followed\
   by responses (although in some instances, command responses are\
   inferred from returned telemetry, described above).\
\
   The final type of application we consider is telescience and the\
   development of a "virtual presence."  This type of application is\
   intended to synthesize great volumes of information about the local\
   environment in order to allow earth-resident scientists, in-situ\
   controlling robots, or eventually in-situ astronauts to interact with\
   high-fidelity models of a portion of a remote environment. To an\
   extent, this technology has already been used to assist in planning\
   the Mars Pathfinder/Sojourner excursions (ref\
   http://www.piercorp.com/Projects/mars/mars2.htm). However, the\
   technology for fully exploiting this type of adjunct to exploration\
   is still in development.  Terrestrial research into telepresence and\
   tele-immersion (ref:\
   http://www.advanced.org/tele-immersion/publications.html) may provide\
   insight into the workload that this type of application might\
   represent for the IPN.\
\
7.2.   Characteristics of remote deployed internets in the IPN\
\
   Although we consider the Earth's Internet to be the first instance of\
   a deployed internet, the environmental characteristics affecting\
   internets deployed in remote locations may differ significantly from\
   those affecting Earth's Internet.  In examining these\
   characteristics, we must differentiate between two different types of\
   environments in the Earth's Internet: the traditional, "wired"\
   environments; and the emerging mobile, ad hoc wireless environments.\
\
   First and foremost among the environmental characteristics of note is\
   that of power availability.  In the "wired" Internet on Earth, power\
   is cheap and plentiful.  Power availability is more of an issue in\
   terrestrial mobile, ad hoc networks (MANETs), because the mobile\
   nodes operate using portable power sources, typically batteries.\
   However, in terrestrial MANETs, the mobile nodes eventually have\
   access to the same cheap and abundant sources of power that the\
\

 \
Internet Draft       draft-irtf-ipnrg-arch-00.txt        May 2001\
\
\
\
   "wired" nodes use.  This is not the case for remote deployed\
   internets (RDIs) in the IPN.  For the foreseeable future, the primary\
   source of power for RDIs in the IPN will be the sun.  Solar power\
   conversion is currently relatively inefficient, but even if dramatic\
   improvements in conversion efficiency occur, the fact remains that as\
   one moves away from the sun, the available power diminishes.  In the\
   orbit of Mars, the average solar intensity is 590 W/m2, less than\
   half of the 1370 W/m2 in Earth orbit [ref:\
   http://powerweb.lerc.nasa.gov/pv/marspower.html ].  On the surface of\
   a planet, the solar intensity is by seasonal variations, by dust\
   build-up on solar panels, and by dust erosion of the solar panels\
   over time.   As a result, power availability is and will be of\
   overriding importance to all aspects of communication in RDIs, and\
   will dictate a need for efficiency at all protocol layers.\
\
   The signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) experienced in the terrestrial\
   wired Internet are currently very high, making loss due to data\
   corruption a rare experience.  In terrestrial MANETs, SNRs are lower,\
   due to both power availability and to node density.  In remote\
   deployed internets, SNRs will be very low, due primarily to power\
   availability.\
\
   In the terrestrial wired Internet, the bulk of the routing\
   infrastructure is fixed in terms of its location.  Conversely, in\
   terrestrial MANETs, the infrastructure is deployed on an as-needed\
   basis, and may be mobile.  In RDIs, this infrastructure is also\
   deployable and mobile, but will have a large component of satellite-\
   based resources.\
\
   If we examine the transmission media in use, the terrestrial wired\
   Internet uses primarily copper cable and optical fiber.  Terrestrial\
   MANETs use free-space propagation in the radio frequency (RF) range\
   or the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum.  In RDIs, we\
   anticipate that free-space RF will be the primary communication\
   medium, even for many permanent, immobile installations as they\
   develop, due to the cost of landing, deploying, and maintaining cable\
   or fiber.\
\
   The cost characteristics of deployment, operations, repair of RDIs is\
   not currently well understood.  However, deployment cost of anything\
   that must be landed on the surface of another planetary body is quite\
   high.  Correspondingly, repair or replacement costs of components of\
   the RDIs are also high.  We do not yet have a clear understanding of\
   how the operations costs of the RDIs will compare to the operating\
   costs of terrestrial MANETs or of the terrestrial wired Internet.\
\
7.3.   Effects of environmental characteristics on protocols for the\
       IPN RDIs\
\
   In considering how to deal with the anticipated operating environment\
   for RDIs, we are encouraged that a significant amount of relevant\
   research is currently under way to support protocols for terrestrial\

\
\
\
   MANETs.  This section briefly reviews some of the areas in which work\
   is required, and is organized by protocol layer.\
\
   At the physical layer, spectrum management is an issue that requires\
   coordination.  There is currently no "Federal Communications\
   Commission" or International Telecommunications Union that regulates\
   use of radio-frequency spectrum outside of earth.  However,\
   coordination of this sort is needed sooner rather than later, due to\
   the attractiveness of certain frequency bands as a result of their\
   free-space propagation loss and refractive characteristics [ref:\
   private communication].\
\
   The cost of landing equipment on remote planetary surfaces motivates\
   designers to keep as much communication infrastructure in orbit as\
   possible.  Low-orbiting satellites will be used extensively to\
   support surface-to-surface communication and RDI-to-RDI\
   communication.  Antenna design to support wideband communication\
   between surface-based mobile nodes and these low-orbiting satellites\
   is an area where research might yield great benefit.  Although we\
   have heard of some research in these areas to support military on-\
   the-move applications, we have seen nothing in detail and feel that\
   it is an area that is ripe for additional study.\
\
   At the link layer, management of low SNRs is of significant\
   importance, with many areas of relevant research.  While many\
   different coding schemes are available, it is not yet clear whether\
   one of these is best for all RDI use or whether the QOS requirements\
   of different types of traffic will dictate the use of different\
   coding schemes on a per-packet basis.  Many codes are currently being\
   considered, including convolutional coding, concatenated codes (such\
   as Reed Solomon codes), and the emerging Turbo codes.  Each of these\
   has different properties related to delay, residual error rate, and\
   link acquisition characteristics.\
\
   Resource reservation schemes at the media access level may be of\
   significant importance in supporting closed-loop control operations.\
   Some of these schemes have the benefits of providing bounded delays\
   and of avoiding interference, which is important in power-constrained\
   environments.\
\
   Link-layer status detection and signaling (to upper layers) is\
   important in resource-constrained environments. We believe that the\
   link layers must detect and signal link availability, link capacity\
   and congestion status, and current error conditions.  As the\
   terrestrial cellular telephone industry becomes internet-enabled,\
   some of these issues are beginning to be addressed in single-hop\
   wireless environments.  There is also ongoing research of interest in\
   MANETs and in DARPA-sponsored research [ref.\
   ftp://ftp.rooftop.com/pub/apis/link_api.pdf ].\
\
   At the network layer, there is a need for routing protocols to\
   support both fast- and slow-moving mobile nodes.  The routing\

 \

\
\
\
   protocols must be able to constitute and maintain networks comprised\
   of a combination of fixed and mobile nodes.  Significant research in\
   this area is currently being performed, and is being coordinated by\
   the IETF's MANET working group [ref.\
   http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/manet-charter.html ].\
\
   Another area of relevant network-layer research concerns "vertical\
   handoffs," which allow nodes to adapt to changes in available links\
   or the resources available via particular links.  This work [ref.\
   http://daedalus.cs.Berkeley.edu/publications/monet97.ps.gz ] is\
   focused on "last-hop" use.  Its potential for use within wireless\
   routers requires further research.\
\
   As link layers enhance their capabilities to monitor and report their\
   status internally to the network layer, network layer control\
   protocols and algorithms must be enhanced to appropriately propagate\
   this information to affected parties within the RDI.  This topic is\
   an active research area, with some applicable work having been done\
   within the SCPS project [ref: http://www.scps.org ].\
\
   Just as resource reservation schemes within the link layer may be\
   important mechanisms for providing bounded link-layer delays,\
   resource allocation schemes at the network layer may also be\
   important for providing such bounds on end-to-end communication\
   within the RDI.  However, resource allocation and resource\
   reservation within mobile wireless networks is still a subject of\
   ongoing research.  Should wireless networks use the integrated\
   services model of resource allocation?  Or should they use the\
   differentiated services model?  It is relatively clear that\
   guarantees of network capacity are not feasible in a highly dynamic\
   environment.  However, the specification of operating ranges may be\
   more tractable, and may provide useful services\
   * To applications (by giving them feedback on available network\
     capacity),\
   * To the transport layer (by providing dynamic rate control\
     information), and\
   * To the network layer (by ensuring that resources are not over\
     allocated in the non-bottleneck portions of the network).\
\
   The applicability to MANETs of the current integrated services versus\
   differentiated services models is the subject of ongoing research\
   [ref: http://comet.ctr.columbia.edu/insignia/,\
   http://www.cs.ucla.edu/~terzis/mobile.html].\
\
   The networks that will be deployed remotely are truly without any\
   fixed infrastructure.  Therefore, the elements of this network will\
   need to establish and maintain the set of services necessary to\
   bootstrap the network.  Self-configuration has relevance here in the\
   areas of addresses allocation and management, name-to-address\
   binding, and dynamic hierarchical organization.  There is ongoing\
   research in all of these areas that is of potential utility, ref:\
   http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/zeroconf-charter.html\

   http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/dnsind-charter.html\
   http://gershwin.utdallas.edu/publications].\
\
   At the transport layer, there is a need for development of new\
   protocols or extensions to existing protocols that are capable of\
   participating in power efficient and mobility-aware communication\
   schemes [ref:\
   http://www.isi.edu/workshop/public_html/wmcw97/nsf4.html ].\
\
   These enhanced transport protocols must be able to adapt to changing\
   network conditions.  This applies in particular to adaptation of the\
   protocol's behavior in order to meet application Quality of Service\
   requirements.  Additionally, support is required for explicit\
   signaling of and responses to changing network conditions such as\
   link outages, congestion, and corruption trends.\
\
   For the foreseeable future, some links in the RDIs will exhibit\
   significant data rate asymmetry (on the order of 100s: 1).  The\
   effective asymmetries may be even higher, since the low-capacity link\
   may not necessarily be dedicated to supporting the movement of data\
   across the high capacity link.  Accordingly, accommodation of\
   significant data rate asymmetries will be required while still\
   maintaining a high degree of power efficiency in the presence of\
   errors.\
\
   At the application layer, service location in mobile ad hoc networks\
   is an issue that is closely related to self-configuration at the\
   network layer, and is of current research interest, ref:\
   http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/zeroconf-charter.html,\
   http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/svrloc-charter.html ).\
   This is important both in initial network startup, and also in the\
   (potentially frequent) case that RDIs with low connectivity become\
   partitioned, either expectedly or unexpectedly.\
\
   Efficient, autonomous network management and control in RDIs is an\
   area of interest.  There is some ongoing research in the area, ref:\
   http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/disman-charter.html,\
   ftp://ftp.ece.orst.edu:/pub/users/singh/papers/anmp.ps.gz\
    that is of potential interest, but this is an area in which further\
   research is required.\
\
   Finally, monitoring the health and status of mobile nodes (not\
   necessarily just the networking components) is of significant\
   importance in RDIs.  The cost to land new elements on a planetary\
   surface is extremely high.  Therefore, we are motivated to perform\
   preemptive maintenance and to repair, rather than replace, failed\
   parts.  The ability to perform these activities autonomously is an\
   area where a significant amount of research is required (and sounds\
   really fun).\

\
7.4.   Summary\
\
   The effects of power limitations in RDIs are significant and will be\
   present in at least some portions of the IPN for the foreseeable\
   future.  These effects strongly suggest the likelihood of some\
   divergence from the standard internet suite of protocols that is in\
   current use on Earth.  Whether these changes become the standard\
   internet suite on Earth, as a result of the significant increase in\
   the use of mobile, wireless internet nodes, remains to be determined.\
   It is also likely that some of the RDIs that are deployed will use a\
   model of organization that is substantially different than that\
   employed in the Internet.  It may be that the IPN treats these\
   networks as single, distributed nodes, but further investigation is\
   required.\
\
8. Working Conclusions\
\
   With the increasing pace of space exploration, Earth will distribute\
   large numbers of robotic vehicles, landers, and possibly even humans,\
   to asteroids and other planets in the coming decades.  Possible\
   future missions include lander/rover/orbiter sets, sample return\
   missions, aircraft communicating with orbiters, and outposts of\
   humans or computers remotely operating rovers.  All of these missions\
   involve clusters of entities in relatively close proximity\
   communicating with each other in challenging environments. These\
   clusters, in turn, will be in intermittent contact with one another,\
   possibly across interplanetary space.  This dual-mode communications\
   environment: relatively cheap round-trips and more constant\
   connectivity when communicating with "local" elements coupled with\
   the very long-delay and intermittent connectivity with non-local\
   elements has led us to the architecture just described, with the\
   following working conclusions.\
\
We need to use a "Pony-Express" model and bundles for interplanetary\
communication\
\
   For communicating between IPN domains such as Earth and Mars, the\
   standard Internet protocols fail, both at the application and\
   transport layers, mainly due to the large delays. Intermittent\
   connectivity and bit error rate are also significant issues, but\
   delay cannot be mitigated by any current means. Communicating over\
   these distances requires a fundamentally different model that does\
   not assume that round-trip-times are cheap.  To combat this we\
   propose a "pony-express" model, where senders submit bundles\
   describing entire transactions to the network, which then uses\
   custody transfers to move bundles from node to node.  Under this\
   model the sender has little or no expectation of real-time delivery\
   of the bundle, which may be stored at intermediate nodes for\
   arbitrary periods of time.  In time, the communications links\
   connecting the various deployed internets will grow to form a stable\
   interplanetary backbone network.\

\
We can't support most legacy applications, even with application-layer\
proxies\
\
   SMTP (e-mail) is perhaps the only application that could possibly be\
   tuned to work over interplanetary distances, but even SMTP has\
   embedded timers that would have to be altered significantly before it\
   would work.\
\
Name tuples consisting of a routing part and an administrative part are\
the means of reference\
\
   To assist in interplanetary routing, we have introduced the notion of\
   an IPN name tuple.  These tuples, each consisting of a topology-\
   related routing part and an administratively controlled\
   administrative part are the analog of IP addresses in the terrestrial\
   Internet.  Just as with IP addresses, bundles carry these name tuples\
   (source and destination) end-to-end.  The routing part of an IPN name\
   tuple serves as an identifier of the destination internet and is\
   consulted to find the next bundle-hop destination whenever the bundle\
   is NOT in its destination IPN region.  The administrative part of an\
   IPN name tuple serves the same function as DNS names in the\
   terrestrial Internet, allowing symbolic names to be used in place of\
   network-layer addresses.  For the IPN region that includes Earth, and\
   possibly others, we envision using actual DNS names as the\
   administrative parts of the tuples.\
\
   This two-part naming approach has a number of advantages.  First, it\
   explicitly allows routing information to be encoded in the IPN name\
   tuple (in the routing part) without interfering with the\
   administrative part.  Second, since the administrative parts of name\
   tuples are only resolved in the destination IPN region,\
   administrative parts of IPN names do not have to be exchanged between\
   IPN regions for the purpose of routing.  Third, while all IPN nodes\
   must be able to interpret the routing part of a name tuple, different\
   name-to-address binding mechanisms for the administrative part can be\
   used in the different regions.  Finally, decoupling the\
   administrative parts of the various IPN regions from one another\
   allows autonomy of the administrative naming in different regions.\
\
IPN Nodes will be used as "impedance-matchers" between the (relatively)\
rich environment of local communications and the long-delay\
interplanetary environment\
\
   We refer to the nodes that perform the store-and-forward operations\
   on bundles simply as interplanetary nodes, and the bundle-agents on\
   these nodes are responsible for routing bundles through the IPN.\
\
We need flexible and bandwidth-efficient security (particularly\
authentication and access control)\
\
   For the foreseeable future, the Interplanetary Internet will be an\
   expensive resource, and an irresistible lure to hackers.  For these\

\
\
   reasons, access to the IPN will need to be strictly controlled and\
   IPN gateways and resources will need to authenticate commands sent to\
   them.  In many cases, data privacy will be required by scientists to\
   ensure that they get first access to the data from their instruments,\
   and integrity will of course be required for command sequences and\
   some telemetry return.  At the same time, the goal of the IPN is to\
   allow scientists, researchers, and on occasion the general public,\
   easy access to information from outside of Earth's domain.  These\
   competing goals will require a flexible security scheme.\
\
   In addition to being flexible, the security mechanisms used over the\
   deep-space links will also need to be bit efficient.  Standard\
   Diffie-Hellman exchanges cannot be used to generate traffic keys, as\
   they require the exchange of several rounds of random information in\
   near-real time.  Something similar to secure email may be a better\
   approach, where the sender applies the appropriate security to the\
   payload of a bundle and then attaches its public key certificate to\
   the bundle.  This approach, while costly in terms of bandwidth, will\
   allow the receiver to immediately authenticate/verify/decode the\
   contents of received bundles.\
\
The long-haul transport protocol used to carry bundles in interplanetary\
space will be very different from TCP\
\
   The transport layer that moves these bundles across interplanetary\
   space will necessarily be very different from TCP, the predominant\
   transport protocol in the terrestrial Internet.  Since bandwidth is a\
   precious commodity in the IPN, the LTP must be "connectionless" in\
   that it cannot wait a round-trip to establish a connection before\
   beginning to send data.  It is quite possible that the LTP will\
   provide partial data delivery where data with "holes" or errors is\
   delivered to the application out of order instead of in order, as\
   with TCP.  A major challenge of the LTP is how to perform flow and\
   congestion control without timely feedback.\
\
Deployed internets may or may not use internet protocols.\
\
   For the "local" communications, between nodes on a spacecraft LAN,\
   elements on the surface of a planet, or between elements on the\
   surface and in orbit, for example, round-trip times are comparable to\
   those in the terrestrial Internet.  In these cases, it is feasible\
   and indeed very reasonable to use protocols like the standard\
   Internet Protocols (TCP/IP).  Using an internet model, and perhaps\
   even versions of the standard internet protocols themselves, will\
   allow deployed devices to easily communicate with one another and to\
   share a common communications infrastructure.  A common, shared\
   infrastructure will free each mission from having to design, build,\
   test, and operate its own custom communications system, and will pay\
   off in terms of development time, development cost, mass,\
   interoperability (reliability), and efficiency. Thus we envision the\
   deployments of fragments that are similar to Earth's Internet to\
   remote locations of interest.  Current advances such as Mobile IP and\

\
\
\
   SCPS that extend the internet model to include mobile nodes and\
   stressed environments will be useful in these environments.\
\
   At the same time, it may be advantageous to use protocols entirely\
   foreign to the internet suite in an "RDI."  For example, it might be\
   preferable in some instances to deploy a self-organizing sensor\
   network in which only data sets, not individual nodes, are\
   addressable.  We believe that the naming method under consideration,\
   where each entity name is divided into an IPN domain part and a\
   domain-specific part, would support these types of RDIs.  The\
   mechanics of how to interface such a network with the rest of the IPN\
   and whether/how such a network could be integrated with an RDI using\
   internet protocols are topics of current discussion.\
\
Terrestrial advances in Mobile Ad Hoc networking are necessary but\
possibly not sufficient for RDIs\
\
   There is a large and growing body of ongoing work in the IETF,\
   universities, and government and private agencies to develop\
   protocols for mobile ad hoc networks.  While much of this work will\
   be directly applicable to the remotely deployed internets, RDIs will\
   remain a breed apart from terrestrial wireless networks.  The main\
   differences are in power and node density.  Terrestrial MANETs, while\
   they may be power-starved, still have the prospect of recharging at a\
   wall socket; elements of an RDI have no such expectation.  Secondly,\
   the density of elements in an RDI may be low compared to a typical\
   terrestrial MANET (although it is too soon to know that a "typical"\
   terrestrial MANET will look like).  The node density may be so low in\
   fact that real-time communications between members of the RDI may not\
   be possible.  This will be the case if many landed elements\
   communicate with one another via a small number of low-altitude\
   orbiters, for example.\
\
9. Security Considerations\
\
   Security is an integral concern of the Interplanetary Internet.\
   Section 5 of this document is devoted to examining the security\
   requirements in the IPN, some potential approaches for securing data\
   in the IPN, and some approaches for securing the backbone\
   infrastructure of the IPN.}{\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252\cocoartf2577

\f0\fs24 \cf0 Signals from the deep space\
A mysterious electromagnetic wave has reached our radio telescopes, scientists are trying to find answers to this enigma.\
\
Five hundred\uc0\u8239 million years ago, a mysterious radio signal was launched from a far-away galaxy, now known by the rather dull name SDSS J015800.28 + 654253.0. When this electromagnetic wave started, the first trilobites of the Cambrian Period had just begun to swim about in the Earth\'92s seas, and it would be another 200\u8239 million years before the first reptiles set foot on land. Since this galaxy with the unpronounceable name is 500\u8239 million light years away from Earth, the signal has only just arrived. It was picked up by the radio telescopes of the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst Project (CHIME/FRB).\
\
This battery of radio telescopes has a total surface area of 2000\uc0\u8239 m2 and is in the White Lake National Park in Canada. From these remote hills, sheltered from almost all manmade electromagnetic disturbance, radio telescopes scan the sky looking for signals coming from the cosmos on radio frequencies between 400 and 800\u8239 MHz. This one from the distant galaxy has been catalogued as an anomalous Fast Radio Burst (FRB). These types of powerful radio signals were discovered in 2007, but it is not yet clear what produces them. We only known that enormous energy sources are needed, the size of nuclear fusions occurring on stars much larger than our Sun.\
\
An unusual signal\
However, until now, all the FRBs discovered have sent out sudden and unpredictable signals. Some have sent a single signal, others more than one, but without any particular rhythm. That said, this most recent prehistoric signal from deep space is something of a surprise. It is as precise as a Swiss watch and repeats exactly over a period of just over two weeks. To be precise, after exactly 4 days of intense activity, the mysterious radio source turns off for just over 12 days, and then begins again with a regular rhythm. The entire cycle lasts exactly 16.35 days and was observed over 28 times from 16 September 2018 to 30 October 2019. This FRB, catalogued as FRB 180916.J0158 + 65, not only has unprecedented regularity, but is also the closest emission to Earth detected since the first FRBs were identified. Numerous research groups have attempted to answer questions about the energy bursts that might be producing these regular signals. We know where they are, but we don't know what they are yet.\
\
\
\
The radio telescopes of the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst Project\
\
Waiting for an answer\
Possible explanations can be put into two broad categories: models that suggest that the environment surrounding the FRB is responsible for the regular rhythm and models that assume that the source itself is being periodically switched on and off. One theory in the first category is that the FRB is orbiting a black hole. Because of this, it may only be able to emit signals towards us when it is in a certain stage of its orbit, when the black hole is unable to swallow the radio signal. But it could be a binary system, where a giant star and a second, very small but very dense star classified as a type of neutron star called a Pulsar, are revolving around each other.\
\
In this case, the radio bursts emitted by the neutron star would be periodically eclipsed by the electromagnetic storms generated by its giant companion. The other category of theories begins with the idea that it is the source itself producing strong emissions at times and then as many pause periods. In fact, another particular class of neutron stars, called Magnetars, is made up of stars that rotate on their axis at very high speed and are able to emit strongly magnetised periodic radio signals. But in all the cases observed so far, Magnetars have periods of rotation that can only be measured for a few seconds, certainly not compatible with a complete cycle of over 16 days.\
\
In the midst of this research by radio astronomy teams around the world, ufologists are also trying to get in on the act, claiming these signals are being sent by extraterrestrial civilisations. We can\'92t rule out the possibility that extraterrestrial civilisations exist and that they are trying to contact their neighbours by transmitting messages encoded in radio signals. Here on Earth we tried the same thing 45 years ago with the Arecibo radio telescope. But if this FRB were produced by an intelligent life form, we would have to conclude that, while animal life was just beginning on Earth, someone, 500 million light years away, already had the capability to use nuclear fusion from entire Suns to signal their presence. More surprisingly, in the following 500 million years, they didn\'92t have the inclination or time to come and visit us!\
\
Stay tuned\
Meanwhile, radio astronomers from all over the world are trying to make sense of this phenomenon and the CHIME/FRB team are analysing the mountain of data already collected over recent years. At the same time they are scanning surrounding space looking for other FRBs that have a similar frequency rhythm to this mysterious radio signal, which as of today is absolutely unique in the entire known Universe and at the same time our neighbour. Does anything change for us? Today, when we want to know what time it is we only have to look at our smartphones, smartwatches or any of the electronic devices we have at hand. The hours and minutes change with precision on our home screens, constantly synchronised thanks to our Internet connections.\
\
Even when daylight saving time changes, we don't have to do anything now, but we all remember just a few years ago, having to check a reliable source from time to time. We turned to the TV time signal and the more sophisticated among us used our radio-controlled clock to pick up the DCF77 signal emitted by the Frankfurt radio station that reached the whole of Italy, except Sicily. But from today, if we really want to show off, we can use a radio telescope tuned to galaxy SDSS J015800.28 + 654253.0 to stay perfectly synchronised wherever we are in the Universe \'96including Sicily!}{\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252\cocoartf2577

SOLAR ACTIVITY & HF PROPAGATION\
(With a \'93Flare\'94 of Solar Physics)\
\
The Sun\'96Earth Interconnect\
Since the late 1800s, it was noted solar activity affected telegraphic lines, and later, radio communications. However,\
there was no scientific proof for this link. From the 1920s onward, radio amateurs clearly correlated HF propagation\
and the MUF to the solar cycle. But again, there was no scientific proof. Astronomers and physicists knew there was a\
sun\'96earth connection, but without direct observational data, it remained an un proven scientific theory.\
The scientific proof did not come until quite recently \'96 basically, the space age \'96 when we got our first look at the sun\
from outside our protective atmosphere. In the 1970s, the Voyager spacecrafts were the first to confirm the existence\
of the solar wind. It was not until Skylab that increases in radiation and the solar wind were linked to solar flares, and\
coronal mass ejections (CME) were first detected. The sun-earth interconnect finally became a scientific fact.\
Since then, numerous satellites and ground based instruments monitor the sun and our geomagnetic field in realtime.\
Today, the radio amateur and QRPer has a wealth of solar information available via the internet that professional\
astronomers did not have a decade ago. This article, in part, describes how to interpret this internet data, and some of\
the terminology encountered in the daily reports and solar data from NOAA. Much of the solar physics in this article\
has been developed by astrophysicists in the past 15 years, and not yet available in other than scientific journals.\

Solar Radiation\
Solar Flux\
If the sun radiated as a thermal source only, the received brightness\
would vary directly with frequency \'96 from ultraviolet and visable\
light down into the radio spectrum. This is called Plank\'92s black body\
radiation law. Optical observations at different wavelengths does\
follow the black body radiation, proving the visible and optical\
wavelengths from our sun are thermally generated. However, radio\
energy does not follow black body radiation, proving the radio\
energy from our sun is being generated by processes other than heat,\
as shown in Fig. 1.\
Deep in the core of the sun is a massive thermo-nuclear reactor\
generating very short wavelength energy (gamma and x-rays). As\
this energy works its way to the surface of the sun, the wavelength\
gets elongated, or stretched, into the radio wavelengths, becoming\
the background radiation from the sun \'96 called the solar flux (SF). It\
is measured at several observatories and reported daily by the\
National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\
at their website: http://www.sec.noaa.gov/today.html. The solar flux\
is low during the quiet sun (SF <100) and elevated during the active\
sun (SF >100). In short, the solar flux is a measure of the ionizing\
radiation from the sun, and an indicator of the electron density of our\
ionosphere. The higher the electron density, the more reflective our\
ionosphere is to HF signals, and the higher the maximum usable\
frequency (MUF).\

The solar flux is measured at 2880 MHz (10 cm), a frequency not generally affected by solar flares, and one where our\
atmosphere is very transparent. Occasionally, a large solar flare will increase the 2880 MHz solar flux. NOAA will\
report this event as a ten-flare, indicating the 10cm solar flux value has been contaminated by a solar flare. Most\
people ignore the elevated solar flux from a ten-flare. However, it does indicate the earth was exposed to increased\
ionizing radiation from the solar flare \'96 ionizing our E and F layers above the normal solar flux.\
QRPers should check the higher bands for openings for several hours following a solar\
flare, or a ten-flare event, due to the enhanced E/F layer ionization, possibly temporarily raising the MUF.\
The daytime ionizing radiation from the sun strips electrons away from their host molecules in our upper atmosphere.\
These free electrons increase the electron density of the ionosphere, stratify into layers, and called the D, E and F\
layers. The E/F layers are reflective to HF signals below the MUF, reflecting them back to earth for long distance\
communications. This is generally called skip propagation. The HF signals must also pass through the D-layer, the\
closest to the earth\'92s surface. This is called the absorption layer, since some of your HF signal will be absorbed by the\
D-layer \'96 in fact, twice \'96 going to, and coming back from the E/F layers for 2-6dB total path loss.\
At night, solar radiation ceases and the free electrons recombine with their host molecules. The D-layer completely\
disappears and offers no signal loss. The E/F layers merge into a single layer, but remain reflective to HF signals.\
However, this combined layer has a lower electron density than daytime levels, lowering the MUF.\
Astronomers call these ionization layers plasma layers and the lowest frequency that escapes into space the plasma\
frequency, fp. QRPers look at it just opposite \'96 what is the highest frequency that does not escape into space? We call\
this the maximum usable frequency or MUF. In reality, the MUF and plasma frequency are exactly the same.\
During the active sun, Earth\'92s plasma frequency is about 18 MHz (nighttime) to 30+ MHz (daytime), and during the\
quiet sun, varies from about 10MHz (nighttime) to around 20 MHz (daytime). Interestingly, the sun\'92s plasma\
frequency varies between 300\'961000 MHz. The only time strong HF radiation escapes the sun is during a solar flare,\
and when it does, it is called a solar storm.\
QRP Propagation Hint:\
 Ionization\
Sunspots and the Solar Cycle\
The solar cycle was first realized by noting\
that sunspots \'93come and go\'94 over a 7\'9611\
year cycle. Sunspots are cooler areas on the\
the solar surface. More recently, sunspots\
have been identified as regions with strong\
magnetic fields called Alpha, Beta and Delta\
groups, as defined in Fig. 2 and illustrated in\
Fig. 3. These active regions are carefully\
watched for possible flare activity.\
An Alpha group are sunspots with no bipolar\
magnetic fields, and seldom produce a flare.\
When bipolar magnetic fields (with N-S, or\
+/\'96 polarization) develop between sunspots,\
it is called a Beta group. When a Beta group\
becomes particularly intense, with strong,\
bipolar magnetic fields between sunspots, it\
is called a Delta group. Amajor flare alert is\
issued by NOAA when a Delta configuration\
develops. A major solar flare will always\
occur from a Beta or Delta group, but, not all\
Beta or Delta groups will produce a flare.\
Terminology seen in the NOAA reports will\

sunspot, surrounded by an outer area with a filament structure called the penumbra. It is believed the filamentary\
structure of the penumbra is \'93painting\'94 a picture of the magnetic field lines emanating from the sunspot. Often NOAA\
will report that a Beta group shows rapid growth in the penumbra. This means the magnetic field lines of the sunspot\
disturbance are rapidly growing, likely into a Delta group, becoming a high candidate for a major flare.\
Until recently, the physics behind a solar flare was not well known. They are extremely energetic events on the sun\
that can produce emissions across the entire spectrum \'96 in the optical wavelengths, gamma and x-rays, down to the HF\
frequencies.\
 The Physics of a Solar Flare\
In many ways, a solar flare is very similar to a nuclear detonation. Imagine\
for a moment, you are about to witness the detonation of an atomic bomb,\
say the Trinity test in New Mexico on July 16, 1945. Sitting in the main\
bunker (see Fig. 4 and 5), you are surrounded by radio equipment to see\
what affect, if any, will occur to the HF and VHF frequencies.\
At 5:29 am, the world\'92s first atomic bomb is detonated. You see a\
tremendous flash of light; the gamma and x-ray detectors are immediately\
triggered, and you hear deafening blasts of noise coming from your\
receivers. Light, ionizing radiation and radio waves are the first forms of\
energy to arrive at the bunker \'96 instantly. They are traveling at relativistic\
speeds \'96 the scientific terminology for the \'93speed of light.\'94\
For the first few seconds, you see a huge, brilliant bubble of plasma and\
burning gasses. Everything inside this bubble is vaporized from the\
extreme temperatures (Fig. 6, t0+.05s). After several seconds, the\
production of gamma and x-rays begins to subside. After about 10\
seconds, the rising gas cloud begins to make the familiar mushroom shape\
(Fig. 6, t0+15s). These are the hot burning gasses, electrons, protons and\
debris rising at about the speed of sound, or at sonic speeds. Along the\
ground, you can see a wall of debris being blown away from the explosion\
by the shock wave.\
Several seconds after the detonation, you hear the thunderous boom of the\
air shock arriving. Several minutes later, the shockwave hits the bunker.\
This is a blast of hot wind traveling over 100 mph, carrying with it dirt,\
rocks and other debris carried along the way.\
A solar flare is not much different. While the exact mechanism triggering a\
flare is not precisely known, it is believed that the strong magnetic field\
lines emanating from the sunspots becomes so strong, hot burning gasses\

sucked out of the interior\
and carried along the\
magnetic field lines of the\
disturbance in a violent\
explosion. While the\
interior of the sun is\

allowed to escape,\

speeds, usually around 1,200\'962,000 km/sec. Being well above the 350\
km/sec. escape velocity of the sun, this shockwave carries some of the\
burning solar mass out into space.\
This shockwave and rising gas cloud of solar mass, being ejected from\
the sun, is called a Coronal Mass Ejection, or CME. It is traveling\
outwards at supersonic speeds and could strike the earth if the trajectory\
and geometry is correct. Some of the burning mass gets caught in the\
magnetic field lines of the disturbance, forming an illuminated loop or\
halo, and called a full-halo CME as shown in Fig. 7.\
The key point is a solar flare releases several major forms of energy that\
can effect VHF and HF propagation on earth:\
1. Ionizing radiation, electrons and protons at relativistic speeds\
 (arrives at earth immediately and for the duration of the flare event)\
2. Asupersonic shockwave riding along with the solar wind\
3. Dense particles behind the shockwave\
 (#2 and #3 arrives at earth 2-3 days after the flare event)\
The emissions from a solar flare in the optical (visible) wavelengths are\
illustrated in Fig. 8. for a typical short-duration flare and the less\
common long-duration flare. An actual brightness plot of a flare,\
measured by photon counts from satellite instrumentation, is also\
shown. This is the optical evidence of the flare, which is actually very\
difficult to detect due to the normally bright surface of the sun. For this\
reason, flares are now determined by the x-ray radiation, detected\
onboard the GEOS, LASCO and SOHO satellites, not optically.\
The optical properties of a flare are not particularly important to the ham\
or QRPer, other than indicating that other things are about to come!\
Fig. 8 also shows the x-rays released from a solar flare. The hard x-rays,\
those >30 kev, is the ionizing radiation striking the earths atmosphere.\
The hard x-rays last only a minute or two, while the soft x-rays can\
persist from tens of minutes to over an hour \'96 all the while showering the\
earth with ionizing radiation. X-rays from very large flares can also\
penetrate our atmosphere, all the way to the ground (a GLE, or ground\
level event). This will highly ionize the D-layer as well, causing an HF\
radio blackout for several tens of minutes following a major flare. This\
is fairly rare, occurring only a few times each solar cycle.\
If you\'92re in a QSO when a major flare causes\
an HF blackout, it seldom lasts more than an hour. If you\'92re working a\
contest, this hint could be useful. Take a break, but don\'92t QRT!\
These x-rays do provide extra ionization to the E/F layers for improved\
reflectivity and a higher MUF. Exploit the benefits of a solar flare.\
Good DX contacts are possible immediately\
following a solar flare until sundown due to the improved reflectivity\
(better signal-to-noise ratio for QRP signals) and the higher MUF\
opening the higher bands \'96 especially during the solar minimum years.\

For the radio amateur and QRPer, the real interest lies in what happens to\
the HF bands. Radio emissions from a flare can cause noise bursts,\
buzzing sounds, sudden QSB, continuum noise, and occasionally, a\
temporary HF blackout. After about 30 minutes following the flare, HF\
noise levels and propagation return to normal.\
The most important thing to remember about a\
solar flare is this: the HF effects are generally only for the duration of the\
flare event (20-60 minutes) and seldom effect frequencies <10 MHz.\
The most damaging effects of a solar flare is actually the arrival of the\
shockwave 2-3 days later, triggering a geomagnetic storm. This is\
discussed beginning on the next page (Geomagnetic Storms).\
The following details of a solar storm is offered for completeness only.\
This is relatively new solar physics theories, and presented for those so\
interested, as the information is currently available only in professional\
astrophysical journals, and certainly not in amateur publications.\
The first radio emissions to arrive on earth following a flare is the bursty\
Type III storm occuring for the first 5-6 minutes following a flare.\
These are relativistic electrons released by the flare traveling through\

the sun\'92s magnetic field (Fig. 10). The radio\
emissions begin around 300 MHz and drift\
downward in frequency at about 20 MHz/sec..\
They sound like ignition noise from a fast running\
engine, or sometimes a \'93buzz\'94 as they sweep past\
your frequency. Seldom will these bursts be heard\
below 10 MHz. Some of these electrons migrate\
and travel along the open field lines in a spiraling\
motion, still about the speed of light, producing\
continuum noise (wideband) from 10\'96300 MHz.\
As the shockwave travels through the sun\'92s\
magnetic field lines, electric currents and bursty\
radio emissions are generated by the dynamo\
effect, called a Type II storm. The sun\'92s plasma\
frequency becomes lower at greater distances.\
Therefore, as the shockwave travels away from\
the sun, the bursts are heard at lower and lower\
frequencies on earth, as shown in Fig. 10.This is\
important to astronomers. By measuring the time\
is takes for the bursts to drift from one frequency\
to a lower one, the velocity of the shockwave can\
be determined.\
Radio Emissions due to the Shockwave\
Radio Emissions from a Solar Flare\
The microwave radiation from a solar flare (Fig. 9) is similar to the ionizing radiation. It can produce powerful radio\
energies for several minutes following a flare, sometimes disrupting satellite and VHF communications. Radio\
telescopes use 2\'9610 GHz (S,C and X band) to make maps of the fine structures of the solar flare. 1.4 GHz, the spectral\
line of hydrogen (L band), is also mapped to show the intensities of local hydrogen and HII during a flare. This reveals\
the amount of ionization, and recombination near the sun\'92s surface. This is interesting from a science viewpoint, but\
not necessarily for ham radio.\

solar wind about 350 km/sec., an increase to 600\
km/sec. generally triggers a minor geomagnetic\
storm, around 1000 km/sec. a major storm, and\
much above that, a severe storm. These, of\
course, are all rough estimates.\
The shockwave also travels through the strong\
magnetic field lines of the disturbance (Fig. 11),\
where the electrons and particles get trapped in\
the closed field lines. This also produces a bursty\
radio emission called a Type I storm. These drift\
downward in frequency at about 2 MHz/sec. and\
sound like ignition noise from an idling car. A\
Type I storm can extend to around 10 MHz and\
persist for 20-30 minutes following a major flare.\
Behind the shockwave is a gas cloud of particles\
from the flare, generating wideband noise called a\
Type IV Continuum Storm. The noise begins\
around 1 GHz. The higher the gas cloud rises, the\
lower in frequency will the noise escape the sun.\
(That solar plasma frequency thing again). These\
particles rise until the pressure of the gas cloud\
equals the pressure of the solar atmosphere. At\
this point (about 15-30 minutes following the\
flare), the particles become stationary and\
generate noise down to 10-20MHz, depending\
upon the height of equilibrium. The Type IV\
storm can persist for hours following the flare and\
is an overall elevation of noise on HF. The exact\
mechanism of this noise emission from the gas\
cloud is not well understood.\
Disturbances to the solar wind, from a solar flare\
or coronal hole, can cause serious disruptions to\
HF by triggering a geomagnetic storm. The solar\
wind is the constant outflow of gasses, electrons,\
and particles from the sun and travel along the\
ecliptic plane, as shown in Fig. 12.\
It was long believed that the solar wind was fairly\
constant, at around 350 km/sec., the escape\
velocity of the sun. We now know that the solar\

wind is highly variable, ranging from the minimum\
350 km/sec. to 2,000 km/sec. or more following a\
major solar flare. From years of satellite data, we\
now know that the sun\'92s electric field is not flat, but\
instead looks more like the \'93balerina skirt\'94 model\
shown in Fig. 13.\
When the earth\'92s orbit enters or exits the skirt, it is\
called a boundry crossing, often reported by\
NOAA.The sudden change in the solar wind speed,\
and direction of flow, can trigger a geomagnetic\
storm. The \'96boundry crossing causes a stronger\
geomagnetic storm than a positive crossing.\
However, they are seldom severe and last only a\
few hours. Fig. 13 shows why the solar wind is\
constantly changing, causing minor geomagnetic\
storms, even during very quiet solar conditions.\
The solar wind exerts a pressure on the earth\'92s\
magnetic field, which distorts the toroidal pattern\
as shown in Fig 14. If this pressure should suddenly\
change, such as with the arrival of a shockwave\
from a solar flare, our magnetic field suddenly\
changes shape in response, causing it to wiggle like\
a bowl of jello. This, in turn, generates strong\
electric currents by the dynamo effect, traveling\
along our magnetic field lines far above our heads.\
This, in turn, generates noise on the HF bands.\
While our geomagnetic field is wiggling, it can\
often produce strong, bursty noise, or \'93static\
crashes.\'94 As the geomagnetic storm begins to\
subside, it settles down to an elevated noise level.\
Often our magnetic field\
gets very quiet following a strong geomagnetic\
storm for 12\'9624 hours. This is an excellent time to\
work 40\'96160M due to very low noise levels.\
Magnetometers on the earth measure the condition\
of our magnetic field. The amount of movement\
(or, \'93wiggling\'94) is averaged and reported by\
NOAA as the K-Index every 3 hours. The K-index\
is a scale from 0\'96 9 representing quiet to severe\
conditions. The K-indices are averaged over 24-\

A Few Final Thoughts\
Putting everything together, a typical strong solar and\
geomagnetic storm is illustrated in Fig. 15. The solar\
flare occurs at time 0, noted on earth by 10-30 minutes\
of noise bursts (Type I, II, III bursts) and elevated noise.\
Almost immediately, the ionizing radiation increases\
the MUF (whether or not it increases the solar flux). 30\
minutes or more after the flare, HF noise levels return to\
normal, quiet conditions.\
This is an excellent window\
for QRPers, right after the flare. As soon as the solar\
storm ceases, HF noise levels become quiet with an\
elevated MUF, lasting until sundown. Night time\
conditions on 80-40M can be excellent. The daytime\
MUF the next day may be elevated as well.\
Shortly after day 2, the shockwave arrives,\
compressing our magnetic field and triggering a major\
geomagnetic storm. HF noise levels immediately rise,\
and in severe cases, may cause an HF blackout.\
Electrons from the shockwave enter the earth at the\
poles, causing a Polar Cap Absorption (PCA) event.\
This causes blackout conditions on HF in the higher\
latitudes. The next 3-hourly K-Index will be high (6\'969),\
sufficient to also trigger auroral activity. A major\
geomagnetic storm (K>6) can last 12\'9624 hours. When\
it finally subsides, our magnetic field often becomes\
very quiet, producing low noise levels on HF.\
This is the other window for\
QRPers, when the geomagnetic storm subsides. Night\
time noise levels on 40-80M can be very low.\
1. The solar flux, indicating the level of ionization,\
affects HF propagation above about 10 MHz. The\
solar flux does not affect 40M and below, since the\
MUF seldom drops below 10 MHz. This is why the\
lower bands are always open.\
2. The K-index, indicating the geomagnetic condition,\
indicates HF noise primarily below about 10 MHz,\
except in severe cases. During a storm, high noise\
levels on 40M doesn\'92t mean high noise on 20M.\
3. 30M is the ham band caught between the 2 worlds.\
It can be affected by both solar flux and the K-index.\
On the other hand, it is more often not bothered by\
either. It is a good band throughout the solar cycle.\
4. Every solar flare and the resultant storm is different.\
No two are alike, nor accurately predictable.\
5. Never let reports of flares or geomagnetic storms\
scare you from getting on the air and checking it out.\

\f0\fs24 \cf0 Scientists think they've detected radio emissions from an alien world\
\
Similar findings may tell scientists about magnetic fields around exoplanets.\
\

Scientists may have detected radio emissions from a planet orbiting a star beyond our sun for the first time.\
\
The astronomers behind the new research used a radio telescope in the Netherlands to study three different stars known to host exoplanets. The researchers compared what they saw to observations of Jupiter, diluted as if being seen from a star system dozens of light-years away. And one star system stood out: Tau Bo\'f6tes, which contains at least one exoplanet. If the detection holds up, it could open the door to better understanding the magnetic fields of exoplanets and therefore the exoplanets themselves, the researchers hope.\
\
"We present one of the first hints of detecting an exoplanet in the radio realm," Jake Turner, an astronomer at Cornell University and lead author of the new research, said in a statement. "We make the case for an emission by the planet itself. From the strength and polarization of the radio signal and the planet's magnetic field, it is compatible with theoretical predictions."\
\

\
Click here for more Space.com videos...\
However, Turner and his colleagues aren't yet positive that the signal they detected really is coming from the planet, dubbed Tau Bo\'f6tes b; the researchers called for additional observations of the system, which is about 51 light-years away from Earth in the constellation Bo\'f6tes.\
\
The new research actually began at Jupiter; the researchers had previously studied that planet's radio emissions and then tweaked those measurements to reflect the effect they expected closeness to the host star and distance from Earth would have had on their observations of an exoplanet.\
\
Then, the scientists consulted observations made in 2016 and 2017 by the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) in the Netherlands. In addition to the potential signal from Tau Bo\'f6tes b, the researchers also report that they may have picked up a signal from the star Upsilon Andromedae or its planet, but that detection was even fainter than the one from Tau Bo\'f6tes b.\
\
The researchers are interested in detecting radio emission from planets because such information may help scientists decipher what's happening in the same worlds' magnetic fields. Those magnetic fields, in turn, influence conditions on the surface of the planet \'97 Earth's magnetic field protects the atmosphere that makes the world one we can survive, for example. Such magnetic fields can also tell scientists about other qualities of a world, like its structure and history.\
\
An artist's depiction of the exoplanet Tau Bo\'f6tes b shows a magnetic field, which may cause the radio emissions scientists believe they have detected.\
\

But so far, studying those magnetic fields directly has been difficult for scientists to manage, despite the fact that nearly every planet in our solar system has had one at some point in its history. Hence the interest in using radio emissions as an intermediate.\
\
"We learned from our own Jupiter what this kind of detection looks like," Turner said. "We went searching for it and we found it."\
\
But that's just the beginning of the story, not the end of it, he emphasized, since the radio emissions could still be coming from the stars or another source instead of the planet. "There remains some uncertainty that the detected radio signal is from the planet. The need for follow-up observations is critical."}{\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252\cocoartf2577

\f0\fs24 \cf0 Space Situational Awareness - Space Weather\
Customer Requirements Document - ESA\
\
Space weather is a component of the natural environment which induces threats through\
its effects on human health and technology both in space and on ground. Micro-particles in\
space of natural or human origin and below 1 millimetre in size similarly constitute an\
environmental threat to human and technology in space and related requirements are\
covered in this document.\
\
The following user needs for the space weather segment can be directly taken from the\
programme proposal:\
\'95 provision of comprehensive knowledge, understanding and maintained awareness\
of the natural space environment and space weather,\
\'95 the detection and forecasting of space weather and its effects,\
\'95 the detection and understanding of interferences due to space weather,\
\'95 the understanding and prediction of the natural meteoroid and small size space\
debris environment that is not covered by the Space Surveillance and Tracking\
(SST) Segment, and its effects,\
\'95 the prediction and/or detection of permanent or temporary disruption of mission\
and/or service capabilities due to space weather.\
\'95 the monitoring of the Sun, the solar wind, the radiation belts, the magnetosphere\
and ionosphere to the extent that it supports services related to effects that include\
radiation and spacecraft charging hazards, spacecraft drag, ionospheric\
perturbations, aircraft radiation hazards, geomagnetic disturbances and current\
induced in large conductive networks such as power lines and pipelines.\
\'95 the provision of all required predicted local spacecraft and launcher radiation,\
plasma and electromagnetic environment data.\
\
The purpose of the SSA SWE segment is to provide for its customers and end users a source\
of space weather data and processed information based on relevant ground based and\
space based sensors and appropriate data processing elements. Space weather effects\
addressed include for example space radiation and spacecraft charging hazards, spacecraft\
drag, ionospheric perturbations on transionospheric radio links, aircraft radiation hazards,\
geomagnetic disturbances and currents induced in large conductive networks such as\
power lines and pipelines. Micro-particle effects addressed include impacts of small space\
debris and meteoroid particles, impacts of debris cloud particles and impacts of meteoroid\
stream particles. SWE segment also provides its customers an access to archives of space\
weather data and all products generated by the SSA SWE system and a latest data service\
including data service for third party service providers.\
\
International Context\
Due to the nature of Space Weather events, global coverage from ground based and space\
borne observation systems is essential for providing operational services. International\
collaboration is a well established tradition in the area of space weather research, providing\
access to geographically distributed measurements. International service coordination is\
currently implemented within the framework of the International Space Environment\
Service (ISES).\
The development of the SSA SWE shall take into account existing collaborations and\
partnerships and aim to establish new agreements where necessary. Coordination will\
further be discussed within International frameworks such as the UN Committee on the\
Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS), the World Meteorological Organisation \
\
2.2 SWE Sensors\
2.2.1 Observation Requirements\
A comprehensive space weather observation network will include ground based and\
spaceborne observatories. In particular, ground based ionospheric sensors, tailored GNSS\
receivers, and magnetometers are key elements to be considered to support the provision\
of information on the ionospheric and the geomagnetic environments. Space based\
measurements of the ionosphere and of the geomagnetic field will enhance the\
measurement coverage to a planetary scale. Detailed information on local aerospace\
vehicle environments can only be obtained from spaceborne observations especially of\
ionising radiation and magnetospheric plasma. The exception for this is the atmospheric\
drag, which can be deduced from ground based satellite tracking systems or from the data\
from onboard orbit determination instruments.\
The forecast of all these environments is enabled by monitoring precursor phenomenon\
that take place on the Sun and propagate in the interplanetary medium before reaching\
Earth. This should be based on the detection of eruptive and pre-eruptive structures on the\
solar disk, as derived from measurements made at visible light, (E)UV and X-ray\
wavelengths, and of the plasma density along with speed and magnetic field in the solar\
wind which flows out from the solar surface, eventually impacting the Earth's geomagnetic\
field. Monitoring of energetic particles in the solar wind is also very important. Solar wind\
measurements and solar observations in the X-ray and (E)UV wavelength ranges can only\
be performed from space. Solar observations at radio wavelengths (e.g. F10.7) may also be\
made from the ground.\

2.2.2 Space Segment Sensors\
The three main system requirements drivers for the SWE Segment spaceborne sensors are:\
- Physical quantities to measure,\
- Continuity of observation (with only gaps that are compatible with service\
requirements),\
- Near real-time data access for nowcasting and forecasting.\
2.2.2.1 Solar Activity Monitoring\
For solar disk imagers and coronagraphs the crucial design drivers are the continuity of the\
observation and pointing to the Sun. These imagers also produce large amount of data\
requiring high data download rates. From the pointing and continuity point of view the\
vicinity of the L1 point would be a good location for these types of sensors. However, the\
requirement for near real-time data implies that as minimum three ground stations equally\
distributed in longitude or a data relay via a geostationary or a geo-transfer spacecraft will\
be required. A Sun-synchronous orbit would also be an option for solar imaging\
instruments, but this option requires a trade-off between the number of ground stations\
and the number of spacecraft to ensure near real-time data download and continuous\
observations. Recent results with the STEREO mission have shown that heliospheric\
imaging from a vantage point away from the Sun-Earth line offers potentially significant\
benefits in solar monitoring and space weather forecasting. STEREO has also provided the\
capacity for stereographic heliospheric imaging from two spacecraft located outside of the\
Sun-Earth line with a wide angle visibility over the space between the Sun and the Earth.\
Spaceborne sensors will have to be used for observations of the solar radio wave spectra\
below ionospheric cut-off frequency.\
2.2.2.2 Solar Wind Monitoring\
For measurements of the solar wind plasma and the interplanetary magnetic field the best\
option is by far a spacecraft orbiting around the first Lagrangian point, L1, because it is a\
unique location for a spacecraft remaining at a stable, intermediate distance between the\
Sun and the Earth. Required data rates and masses of instruments are low but near realtime data download would require at least 3 ground stations or data relay via a\
geostationary or geo-transfer spacecraft. Additional options for a spacecraft location closer\
to the sun would provide potential benefits as the warning time before geomagnetic\
impacts would increase. The station keeping for a spacecraft between the L1 point and the\
Sun is naturally a major challenge and the complexity of the mission against the potential\
benefits would have to be carefully assessed before implementing a mission like this is\
considered.\

2.2.2.3 Space Radiation Environment Monitoring\
Sensors will measure both trapped radiation and solar energetic particles. Sensors will\
have to cross the radiation belts to measure the trapped radiation. A geo-transfer orbit\
(GTO) provides a comprehensive sampling of the trapped radiation environment. In\
contrast, SEP monitoring should be done either at GEO or from a location outside the\
magnetosphere. Combination of sensor locations can provide feasible observation\
scenarios especially when hosted payload opportunities are utilised. Naturally all in-situ\
observations of space radiation environment need to include spacecraft orbit information\
at the times of the data sampling. This applies also to cases where radiation data is\
collected by sensors that are part of the spacecraft bus and the data is considered as part of\
the spacecraft telemetry.\
2.2.2.4 Geomagnetic Environment Monitoring\
Spaceborne sensors are required for in-situ observations of the local magnetic field. Global\
coverage is required at altitude ranges from LEO to GEO. Spaceborne sensors are also\
needed for the observations of the low frequency magnetospheric radio wave spectra. They\
are also required for particle precipitation measurement (fluxes and average energies) and\
the plasma environment.\
Spaceborne Auroral observations require sensors for auroral visible and UV imaging and\
auroral kilometric radiation.\
2.2.2.5 Upper Atmosphere Monitoring\
Planetary coverage of ionospheric monitoring can be achieved by polar orbiting satellites.\
The number of sensors needed depends on the continuity and sampling requirements.\
Timeliness requirements are the driver for the number of ground based stations and/or\
relay satellites needed in the system.\
Spaceborne thermospheric neutral wind and density observations are the only way to\
achieve global measurement coverage as ground based FPI observations only allow local\
sampling. Space based radio occultation measurements can provide global measurements\
of the ionospheric electron density profiles.\
2.2.2.6 Microparticle Monitoring\
Sensor data about the microparticle flux as a function of size, velocity and angular\
distribution is required from spaceborne sensors. Coverage of GEO, polar LEO, and ISS\
flight altitudes are required.\

2.2.3 Ground Based Sensors\
The main system requirements drivers for the SWE Segment ground based sensors are the\
same as for the spaceborne sensors. The main limitation for ground based observations is\
the filtering of the atmosphere for the solar EM and particle radiation. Global coverage in\
ground based observations typically requires either establishing sensors outside the ESA\
Member States or international collaboration with sensor owners outside Europe.\
2.2.3.1 Solar Activity Monitoring\
The basic ground based observations for solar activity include solar radio observations,\
white light imaging, H-alpha imaging and measurements of the solar surface magnetic field\
with line-of-sight and vector magnetograph techniques. The solar radio emissions are\
observed with broad frequency radio spectrographs and radio imaging of the sun.\
2.2.3.2 Solar Wind Monitoring\
Solar wind observations from the ground are very limited. Potential instruments for\
estimation of the solar wind characteristics include scatter radars, radio telescopes and\
muon and neutron monitors.\
2.2.3.3 Geomagnetic Environment Monitoring\
Observations of geomagnetic field disturbances are required globally using data from\
networks of ground based magnetometers. Ground based geomagnetic monitoring also\
includes Auroral imaging by all sky cameras.\
2.2.3.4 Upper Atmosphere Monitoring\
Ground based observation of the upper atmosphere include ionospheric monitoring by e.g.\
GNSS receivers, ionospheric scintillation receivers, ionosondes, riometers and scattering\
radars. Observations of the neutral wind are performed by ground based Fabry-Perot\
interferometers (FPIs).\
2.3 SWE Segment Services\
Space weather is a component of the natural environment which induces threats through\
its effects on human health and technology both in space and on ground. Micro-particles in\
space of natural or human origin and below 1 millimetre in size similarly constitute an\
environmental threat to humans and technology in space and related requirements are\
covered in this document.\

ABSTRACT\
Developments in space technologies are\
enabling the realization of deep space scientific\
missions such as Mars exploration. Interplanetary\
(IPN) Internet is expected to be the next step in\
the design and development of deep space networks as the Internet in the space. However, there\
are significant challenges to be addressed for the\
realization of this objective. This article captures\
the current state of the art and open research\
challenges, and intends to motivate researchers\
around the world to tackle these challenging problems and help realize the IPN Internet.\
INTRODUCTION\
Developments in the space technologies are\
enabling the realization of deep space scientific\
missions such as Mars exploration. These missions produce significant amounts of scientific\
data to he delivered to the Earth. In addition,\
these missions require autonomous space data\
delivery at high data rates; interactivity among\
in-space instruments such as satellites, asteroids,\
robotic spacecrafts, and crewed vehicles; security\
of operations; and seamless interoperahility\
between in-space entities.\
For successful transfer of scientific data and\
reliable navigational communications, NASA\
enterprises have outlined significant challenges\
for development of next-generation space network architectures. The next step in the design\
and development of deep space networks is\
expected to be the Internet of the space planetary networks and defined as the interplanetary\
(IPN) Internet [I].\
The IPN Internet is envisioned to provide\
communication services for scientific data delivery and navigation services for the explorer\
spacecrafts and orbiters of the future deep space\
missions [2]. However, there are significant challenges posed by the deep space networking\
paradigm that need to he addressed for this\
objective:\
Extremely long and variable propagation\

Asymmetrical forward and reverse link\
capacities\
9 High link error rates for radio frequency\
* Intermittent link connectivity\
- Lack of fiwed communication infrastructure\

strength and protocol design\
Power, mass, size, and cost canstraints for\

Backward compatibility requirement due to\
high costs involved in the deployment and\

Many researchers and several international\
research organizations are currently engaged in\
addressing these challenges and developing the\
required technologies for realization of IPN\
Internet. In this article we present a survey of\
the proposed architectures and communication\
protocols and algorithms for deep space networks and Interplanetary Internet. Our objective\
is to provide better understanding of the current\
research issues in this field.\
(RF) communication channels\
INTERPLANETARY\
INTERNET ARCHITECTURE\
A common infrastructure for interplanetary networking and distributed communication technologies are needed to support scientific\
research and possible commercial applications in\
the near future. Since the Internet is truly horizontal and has a diverse set of open interoperable standards, building the space Internet on top\
of Internet technologies could enable any space\
mission to \'93plug in\'94 with high quality of service\
and cost savings. Therefore, most network architectures proposed for deep space exploration are\
based on Internet technologies.\
A general infrastructure is introduced in [3]\
for the NASA space Internet, which contains a\
backbone network, an access network, an inrerspacecraft network, and a proximity network. The\
space Internet is described as a network of Internet.7 [4], with a specialized deep space backbone\
network of long-haul wireless links interconnecting these local Internets. Internet or Internetrelated protocols are used to form local networks\
with low-delay relatively low-noise environments\

hoc manner (e.g., sensor nodes and balloons), as illustrated in Fig. lh.\
In summary, the entire IPN Internet architecture shown in Fig. la and b is decomposed into\
different suhneworks. Each subnetwork faces\
different challenges and has its own design\
requirements. Therefore, a common protocol\
stack is needed to integrate the differently challenging parts together and extend the terrestrial\
Internet into its IPN counterpart. Meanwhile, it\
also leaves space to develop protocols adaptive\
to the peculiar circumstances in each suhnetwork.\
COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL SUITE\
As the IPN Internet consists of heterogeneous\
network architectures as shown in Fig. la, each\
of these components may have to run a different\
set of protocols that best fits the environment\
[SI. In this section we explore the current and\
proposed protocol suites to realize communication in the IPN Internet.\
THE CURRENT CCSDS SPACE/\
GROUND PROTOCOL STACK\
The current spacelground protocol stack is proposed by the Consultative Committee for Space\
Data Systems (CCSDS) for space communications [4]. It is used for Mars explorations [4],\
and its functionalities are mapped to the generic\
layers of the current spaceiground protocol\
stack space wireless frequency and modulation\
(layer l), space channel coding and space link\
(layer Z), space networking (layer 3), space endto-end security (layer 4), space end-to-end reliability (layer 5), and space file transfer (layer 6),\
as shown in Fig. 2a.\
Although the current protocol stack seems\
viable, there is also a need to make the protocol\
stack adaptable to different environmental\
changes, allowing integration of highly optimized\
regional network protocols. For example, the\
protocols used for the Earth and Mars are different, as shown in Fig. 2a. As a result, a proposed protocol stack [5] for future space\
exploration is described. There is ongoing\
research on making the stack adaptable with the\
perceived capabilities.\
A DELAY-TOLERANT\
NETWORKING PROTOCOL STACK\
The ability to integrate highly optimized regional\
network protocols is the objective of the future\
spacelground protocol stack developed by the\
Delay-Tolerant Networking Research Group\
(DTNRG) [5]. The protocol stack relies on a\
middleware layer called the bundle layer [4, 51\
that resides between the application and the\
lower layers. The bundle layer resolves intermittent connectivity, long and variable delay, asymmetrical data rates, and high error rates by using\
a store-and-forward mechanism similar to email.\
It sends a bundle of message fragments to the\
next-hop node with per-hop error control, which\
increases the probability of data transmission.\
The DTN future spacelground protocol stack\
with the bundle layer is illustrated in Fig. 2b.\
110 IEEE Communications Magazine - July 2004 \
The bundle layer consists of many services such\
as bundle routing, bundle custody transfer, bundle end-to-end reliability, bundle authentication,\
and bundle encryption, which are currently\
undenvay and should be ready by the middle of\
this decade (4, 51.\
PHYSICALAYER TECHNOLOGIES\
The physical layer is mainly responsible for frequency selection, carrier frequency generation,\
signal detection, modulation, and data encryption. Most of the significant challenges for the\
realization of the IPN Internet exist due to the\
physical layer issues.\
THE IPN BACKEONE NETWORK\
Wireless communication systems depend on\
radiated RF energy, which is subject to spreading loss. This problem leads to significant signal\
powcr degradation over very long distance deep\
space links. In addition to this, the signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) requirement to reliably decipher the received symbols amplifies the problem.\
One possible approach is to increase the radiated signal power via high-power amplifiers such\
as traveling wave tubes (TWTs) or klystrons,\
which can boost output power up to several\
thousand watts. However, this comes at the\
expense of increased antenna size and cost, and\
power problems for remote deep space nodes.\
NASA's deep space network (DSN) is\
designed to operate in the S- and X-bands (2\
GHz and 8 GHz, respectively) with 70 m antennas used for spacecraft telemetry, tracking, and\
command for deep space missions. The new 34 m antennas being designed to operate at the Kaband (32 GHz) will improve the data rate over\
currently achievable X-band frequencies [6]. On\
the other hand, despite their current technological immaturity, due to much higher data rates,\
and reduced mass, size, and power requirements,\
optical communication technologies will also be\
employed to achieve high data rates in the IPN\
Internet backbone links [2, 71. However, the\
deployment of optical communication technologies for the IPN Internet still remains largely\
unexplored.\
On top of the RF backbone technology, carrier frequency selection and RF modulation\
schemes for different space missions have been\
recommended by the CCSDS [SI. Furthermore,\
several channel coding schemes have been studied and recommended by the CCSDS for the\
deep space channel, including basic convolutional, punctured convolutional, concatenated; and\
turbo codes to be used based on the performance requirements of the specific space mission [8]. Howcver, due to their high coding gain,\
compliance with CCSDS recommendations, and\
reduced recciver complexity, turbo codes are\
mostly studied as a channel coding scheme at\
the physical layer of the deep space channel.\
THE PLANETARY NETWORK\
The most important challenge in the design of\
physical layer technologies for the communication nodes in planetary surface networks is their\
physical limitations (e.g., size, mass, and power\
constraints). Therefore, for planetary satellite\
and surface networks, novel physical layer technologies need to be developed such as small volume, mass, and low-power RF receivers and\
transmitters operating over the UHF, X-band,\
and Ka-band frequency regimes; and low-power\
infrared for planetary surface communications.\
OPEN RESEARCH ISSUES\
'Open research issues in the physical layer technologies are summarized as follows:\
* Signal power loss: Powerful and size-, mass,\
and cost-efficient antennas and power\
amplifiers need to he developed to minimize the effects of the spreading loss. - Optical communications: Optical communication technologies should be researched\
for possible application to the IPN backbone network.\
- Hardware design: Low-power low-cost\
transceiver and antennas need to he\
designed for planetary networks.\
* Modulation schemes: Simple low-power\
modulation schemes need to be developed\
for the communication nodes in planetary\
surface networks.\
DATA LINK LAYER ISSUES\
The data link layer is mainly responsible for the\
multiplexing of data streams, data frame detection, medium access, and error control. It performs transmission of the upper-layer protocol\
data units over the physical space channel.\
MEDIUM ACCESS CONTROL\
Medium access control is required in the data\
link layer to accommodate multiple nodes sharing the same transmission medium by utilizing\
network resources with maximum efficiency and\
minimum contention. We explore the issues pertaining to MAC separately for the IPN backbone\
network and planetary networks.\
The IPN Backbone Network -The challenges posed by the IPN backhone link for the\
MAC layer protocols can be summarized as follows:\
Very long propagation delay: The IPN backbone links have extremely high propagation\
delays.\
Physical design change constraints: The\
MAC protocols should be designed such that\
minimum physical or hardware changes are necessary at the controllers in space.\
Topological changes: Due to possibly frequent topology changes, MAC protocols need to\
accommodate reconfigurability and dynamic\
access control mechanisms.\
Power constraint: The limitation in power\
requires stringent use of memory, processing,\
and communication powers, which require\
power-efficient MAC designs. ' '\
Extensive performance evaluation is yet to be\
performed to assess the suitability and performance of the fundamental fixed channel assignment based MAC schemes including\
frequency-division multiple access (FDMA):\
time-division multiple access (TDMA), and\
code-division multiple access (CDMA) and theii\
variants in the IPN Internet. On the other hand.\
Due to its high\
coding gain,\
compliance with\
CCSDSrecom- ,\
mendations, and ,\
reduced receiver\
comp/exity, Turbo\
codes are mostly\
studied as a\
channel coding\
scheme at the\
physical layer of\
the deep space\
channel.\

~~ ~\
the link layer for the deep space long-haul links\
has been addressed thus far by the packet\
telecommand and packet telemetry standards [E]\
established by the CCSDS. Packet telecommand\
incorporates the vinual channelization method,\
which is responsible for the MAC layer functionalities. Virtual channelization allows various\
sources to be virtually granted exclusive access\
to the physical channel by assigning them transmission capacity on a frame-by-frame basis.\
Planetary Networks - For pla'netary networks, the MAC protocols proposed for satellite\
communications can be used at planetary Satellite networks with proper modifications and\
improvements. The MAC layer issues for the\
planetary surface network, on the other hand,\
could be addressed by incorporating the existing\
MAC protocols for mobile ad hoc networks and\
wireless sensor networks [2]. However, these\
solutions need proper modifications and\
improvements to address the heterogeneous networking environments of the planetary networks.\
The Proximity-I link layer protocol [8] is currently being developed by the CCSDS as a hidirectional data link layer protocol specifically\
designed for short-range communications\
between surface vehicles and planetary orbiters\
in the planetary satellite network. The MAC\
sublayer of Proximity-1, which is one of five protocol suhlayers, is responsible for the establishment and termination of each communication\
session and for any operational changes in the\
physical layer configuration [SI. Although the\
protocol specification includes some procedures\
for contention management of multiple orbiters,\
further research is required to obtain a concrete\
solution that addresses the medium access problems of planetary networks in the IPN Internet.\
ERROR CONTROL\
Another important function of the data link\
layer is the error control of transmission data.\
Typical error control mechanisms fall into two\
classes: Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) and\
forward error correction (FEC). Here, we\
explore the currently proposed error control\
techniques and their shortcomings for IPN backhone and planetary networks.\
The IPN Backbone Network -All NASA\
missions, including Earth orbit and deep space,\
design their RF systems to provide or hetter bit error rate (BER) after physical link coding [9]. Hence, the data link layer and its error\
controllcorrection capabilities play a crucial role\
in the overall performance of deep space communications for both data and multimedia traffic\
delivery.\
On top of the channel coding mechanisms\
standardized by the CCSDS [E], the packet\
telecommand standard of the CCSDS seeks to\
achieve link-layer reliability by providing a GoBack-n frame retransmission protocol, known as\
the Command Operation Procedure (COP) [4].\
However, COP is mainly designed to address\
short-range communication links. In [E] the\
advance orbiting systems recommendation by\
CCSDS includes a space link ARQ protocol\
(SLAP) for handling link layer issues of space\
missions. SLAP performs ARQ link layer protocol over created virtual channels. However, in\
order to further strengthen the ARQ mechanism\
over IPN backbone links with very long propagation delay, the virtual channels are protected by\
Reed Solomon FEC codes.\
PlaNetary Networks - Due to the similarities\
between planetary satellite network links and\
terrestrial satellite channels, the FEC schemes\
proposed for terrestrial satellite links can be\
applied to planetary satellite networks.\
As planetary surface networks are composed\
of several mobile and static wireless ad hoc and\
sensor networks, the error control solutions proposed for terrestrial wireless, wireless sensor,\
and ad hoc networks are possible candidates for\
this environment. In this respect, ARQ is a\
viable option due to its low-delay access links.\
However, ARQ alone may lead to significant\
communication inefficiency in the presence of\
high link errors due to harsh space environments\
and atmospheric effects. Furthermore, the scarcity of power resources at remote communication\
nodes such as sensors, landers, and rovers\
require specifically tailored FEC schemes that\
have high energy efficiency as well as powerful\
correcting capability. Hence, hybrid ARQ\
schemes with simple encoding techniques that\
enable easy decoding might he preferred as\
energy-efficient solutions for planetary surface\
networks.\
OPEN RESEARCH ISSUES\
The key open research issues for the link layer\
problems can he summarized as follows:\
MAC for the IPN backbone network: New\
MAC protocols should be devised that can\
accommodate extremely-long-delay IPN backhone links as well as high link errors.\
MAC for planetary networks: New and\
preferably adaptive MAC protocols need to he\
developed in order to maintain seamless communication for reliable data and time-sensitive\
multimedia flows throughout the planetary surface and satellite networks.\
Error control schemes: New and very fast\
FEC schemes, new adaptive error control\
schemes, and hybrid ARQ mechanisms need to\
be researched to achieve unified efficient error\
control in planetary networks and planetary surface networks, respectively.\
Cross-layer optimization: Interactions\
between the link layer and physical, network,\
transport layers should he exploited to the fullest\
while developing MAC protocols and error control techniques as well as network and transport\
layer solutions. Furthermore, the optimal packet\
size for the data link layer should be investigated\
to minimize overhead and maximize link utilization in the IPN Internet.\
NETWORK LAYER lSSUES\
In the IPN Internet architecture as shown in Fig.\
la and h, end-to-end communication includes\
identifying the communicating endpoints, as well\
as the routing in the IPN backbone network,\
planetary networks, and IPN external networks.\
While the existing routing protocols for mobile\
112 IEEE Communications Magazine July Zw4 \
ad hoc and sensor networks can he applied to\
IPN external networks, there are significant challenges that necessitate specifically tailored solutions for routing in other parts of the IPN\
Internet. In the following sections, the design\
issues of naming and addressing in the IPN\
Internet, and routing in the IPN backbone network and planetary networks are explored.\
NAMING AND ADDRESSING\
In today's Internet. addressing is used for routing purposes. The matching of global unique\
destination addresses in a router's local forwarding table gives the next-hop address. Naming is\
applied to make the addressing easier for\
humans. Namingiaddressing translation is done\
through domain name server (DNS) services.\
Tiered naming and addressing [5] is proposed to\
address the challenges in employing DNS in the\
IPN Internet with long delay links. A name tuple\
identifies a communicating entity and comprises\
two variable-length portions: \{region ID.\
entity ID\}. The region ID identifies the\
entity's region and is known by all regions in the\
IPN Intcmet. The entity ID is a name local to\
the entity's region and is treated as opaque data\
outside this region. The resultant late binding\
avoids having a universal name-to-address binding space and preserves a significant amount of\
autonomy within each region.\
Tiered naming and addressing enables new\
regions with new naming and addressing systems\
to be added with no impact on previously\
deployed nodes, and keeps DNS translation efficient in the IPN Internet. It is suggested in [SI\
that the names be directly used to identify\
objects. For addressing in the IPN Internet, the\
objcctive is to make it as compatible as possible\
with existing IP technologies. Therefore, Internet address space is used in [8] to identify the\
objects.\
To support end-to-end communication in the\
IPN Internet, the expected new universal\
addrcssing scheme should perform the following\
functions:\
* Locate the elements in a hierarchical way in\
the IPN Internet architecture; support efficient routing through different subnetworks\
and under node movement.\
Allow the IPN Internet to expand while\
maintaining the addressability of previously\
deployed elements.\
* Allocate and retrieve addresses dynamically.\
THE IPN BACKBONE NETWORK\
The IPN backbone network in Fig. la provides\
data delivery across interplanetary distances to\
support deep space exploration.\
Challenges and Related Work - The main\
challenges that affect network layer design in the\
IPN backbone network are as follows:\
Lung and variable delay: In networks with\
extremcly long propagation delays, routing protocols most sevcrely affected are the distributed\
algorithms that require timely dissemination of\
state to avoid route inconsistencj.. The movement of nodes in the IPN backbone network\
adds to delay variation.\
Intermittent connectivity: Intermittent links\
IEEE Communications Magazine July 2004\
cause several challenging problems: determining\
the predicted time and duration of intermittent\
links and the degree of uncertainty of these estimates, obtaining knowledge of the state of pending messages, scheduling their transmission when\
the link becomes available, and abandoning the\
wait for a predicted link.\
Space Communication Protocol Standards - Network Protocol (SCPS-NP) by CCSDS [8] is\
proposed as a scalable network protocol for inspace routing through space networks. To allow\
designers to accommodate differences from one\
mission to another, SCPS-NP employs a scalable\
bit-efficient header using a technique called\
capability-driven header construction to reduce\
the transmission overhead. The fofmat of the\
packet header is based exclusively on the protocol's capabilities required for each particular\
datagram. Routing tables can be configured\
either statically, centrally, or locally. In addition,\
a selectable routing method is used for datagrams\
with different priorities. However, a detailed\
routing algorithm is lacking in SCPS-NP to deal\
with the above-mentioned challenges in the IPN\
backbone network.\
The IPN Internet can he regarded as a special type of the DTN discussed earlier. To deal\
with the intermittent property of IPN backbone\
links, the tiered routing mechanism [5] uses both\
current and expected connectivity information.\
Specifically, routes through the IPN backbone\
network comprise a sequence of contacts that\
indicate the duration, endpoints, and forwarding\
capacity of a link in the topology graph. A future\
network topology consisting of contacts is estimated. If an episode of connectivity does not\
occur as expected, rerouting is conducted accordingly.\
Open Research hues - Despite some protocols proposed for routing in the IPN backbone\
network, the followine research issues need further expioration: L\
Distribution of tuoolugv . I. information: Onehop link state information and a distance-vector'\
type of aggregation beyond one hop can be\
maintained to obtain a probabilistic view of the\
overall topology. Moreover, the trajectory and\
velocity information of backbone nodes can be\
distributed to help make routing decisions.\
Path calculation: Optimal path selection and\
transmission are difficult due to the temporal\
nature of the topology graph and the nonuegligible link transit time. Hop-by-hop routing is\
expected using incomplete topology information\
and probabilistic estimation.\
PIANETARY NETWORKS\
Routing in planetary networks is necessary to\
achieve end-to-end communication between\
Earth and outer space planets. It also integrates\
local planetary components to realize\
autonomous communication and control.\
Challenges and Related Work - The challenges for routing in the planetaly network are:\
Extreme power constraints: Space elements\
mainly depend on rechargeable batteries using\

TRANSPORT LAYER lSSUES\
Transport layer functionalities are necessaly for\
both reliable transfer of scientific data and timely delivery of multimedia information in the IPN\
Internet. Among the architectural elements of\
the IPN Internet, the IPN backbone network\
poscs the most challenging problems for reliable\
data and multimedia transport in the IPN Internet as outlined below:\
Very long propagation delays: The end-toend round-trip time (RTT) for the Mars-Earth\
communication network varies from 8.5 to 40\
min according to the orbitdl location of the planets. Similarly, the end-to-end RTT from Jupiter\
and Pluto to Earth vary between approximately\
81.6 to 133.3 min and between 593.3 to 1044.4\
min, respectively.\
High link error rates: The raw BERs on the\
IPN backbone links are on the order of 10-I.\
Blackouts: Periodic link outages may occur\
due to orbital obscuration with loss of line of\
sight because of moving planetary bodies or\
spacecraft.\
Bandwidth asymmetry: Asymmetry in the\
bandwidth capacities of the fonvard and reverse\
channels is typically on the order of 1OOO:l in\
spacecraft missions.\
The existing transport layer protocols proposed for terrestrial, satellite, wireless, and ad\
hoc networks with appropriate modifications and\
improvements can he applied to IPN external\
networks and planetary networks as shown in\
Fig. la. However, the above challenges posed by\
the IPN backbone network need new specifically\
tailored transport layer solutions.\
RELIABLE DATA TRANSPORT IN THE\
IPN BACKBONE NETWORK\
Related Work - The challenges posed by the\
IPN backhone links necd to be addressed in\
order to meet the communication requirements\
of deep space missions and realize the IPN\
Internet. However, the existing reliable transport\
protocols have been shown to achieve very poor\
performance in deep space communication networks. The dominant factor in this performance\
degradation is the extremely high propagation\
delay in deep space links. This is solely due to\
the window-based mechanism used by the current TCP protocols. Although there are transport protocol solutions proposed for satellite\
links [13], these solutions cannot be directly\
applied to the IPN backbone network because of\
the extremely high propagation delay and the\
other challenges mentioned above.\
Space Communications Protocol StandardsTransport Protocol (SCPS-TP) [SI is a set of\
TCP extensions developed hy the CCSDS. SCPSTP mechanisms are basically a combination of\
existing TCP protocols with Some modifications\
and extensions to address link errors, bandwidth\
asymmetry, and link outages, which are shown to\
he inadequate to addres the challenges in the\
IPN backbone network. The CCSDS File Delivery Protocol (CFDP) [8] has also been developed for reliable file transport over space links.\
In [SI, as mentioned before, the bundling\
approach, which performs a custody-based sfore114 IEEE Communication5 Magazine * July 2004 \
and-forward approach, is introduced to address\
the intermittent connectivity, large and variable\
delays, and high BERs. Although this approach\
achieves reliable transport over intermittent\
links, it still requires a specifically tailored transport protocol for high-performance bundle transport between two IPN Internet nodes.\
In [14] a reliable transport protocol, TP-Planet, for the IPN backbone network is introduced.\
Two novel algorithms, Initial State and Steady\
State, constitute the structure of TP-Planet. Initial State replaces the inefficient slow start algorithm in order to capture link resources in a very\
fast controlled manner. In Steady State a new\
congestion detection and control mechanism is\
deployed to minimize erroneous congestion\
decisions due to high link errors. TP-Planet\
deploys a newly developed end-to-end ratebased additive-increase multiplicative-decrease\
(AIMD) congestion control, whose AIMD\
parameters are adjusted to compensate for\
throughput degradation. In order to reduce the\
effects of blackout conditions on throughput\
performance, TP-Planet incorporates a Blackout\
State procedure into protocol operation. Bandwidth asymmetry is addressed by the adoption of\
delayed selective acknowledgment (SACK)\
options. It is shown in [14] via simulation experiments that TP-Planet significantly improves the\
throughput performance and addresses the challenges in the IPN backbone network.\
.\
MULTIMEDIA TRANSPORT IN THE\
IPN BACKBONE NETWORK\
Audio and visual information including planet\
images are one part of the aggregated traffic in\
the IPN backbone network. Control of multimedia traffic is an important problem, because\
uncontrolled multimedia traffic not only can\
congest the network, but can also cause unfairness and starvation for other data traffic.\
Challenges - In addition to the challenges for\
reliable data transport in IPN backbone networks described earlier, there are the following\
additional challenges due to the unique requirements of multimedia transport:\
Bounded jitter: Multimedia traffic has strict\
requirements on bounded variation of the endto-end delay (i.e., jitter), because it can cause\
problems in reconstructing multimedia.\
Minimum bandwidth: Most multimedia applications require minimum bandwidth in order to\
maintain minimum perceived media quality.\
Smooth traffic: Abrupt and frequent fluctuations in the media rate can cause significant\
degradation in received media quality.\
Error Control: Despite the existing error\
resilience techniques, compressed video is still\
highly sensitive to data loss and requires efficient error control mechanisms due to high link\
errors in the IPN Internet.\
Related Work - Many multimedia transport\
protocols are proposed to control the flow of\
multimedia traffic in terrestrial networks. These\
proposed protocols can he categorized mainly\
into two types of rate control schemes, AIMDbased and equation-based.\
AIMD-based rate control schemes are TCPcompatible; that is, they follow TCP behavior to\
conservatively update the sending rate based on\
feedback information. However, all of these\
existing AIMD-based rate control schemes are\
developed based on the assumption that the\
propagation delay is relatively short, which does\
not hold in the IPN backbone network links.\
Moreover, the AIMD schemes cause abrupt and\
frequent fluctuations in the media rate in the\
form of a sawtooth pattern, which is not suitable\
for most multimedia applications.\
Equation-based rate control schemes are proposed to provide relatively smooth congestion\
control for multimedia traffic by adjusting the\
transmission rate using the throughput estimate\
of the corresponding TCP counterpart experiencing the same packet loss rate and RIT. Although\
the use of the TCP response function for\
throughput estimate ensures long-term fairness,\
the steady-state throughput model of a TCP\
source is highly sensitive to RTT values, which\
prevents equation-based schemes from achieving\
high link utilization in the IPN backbone network\
links with extremely high propagation delay.\
RCP-Planet [I51 is proposed to address the\
challenges of the rate control problem for multimedia traffic in the IPN Internet. RCP-Planet\
consists of two novel algorithms, Begin State and\
Operational State. In Begin State, an RCP-Planet\
source conservatively sets the initial media rate\
to be the minimum media rate required by the\
application in order not to inject too many packets into the network. Based on a novel rate probing mechanism, RCP-Planet deploys a new rate\
control scheme to update the media rate smoothly and conservatively in Operational State. In\
order to recover packet losses due to link errors\
and congestion, tornado codes are used for\
packet-level FEC because of their very low\
encoding and decoding times. Furthermore,\
FEC block-level ACKs are used to address handwidth asymmetry problems. Apart from that, the\
blackout state is incorporated into RCP-Planet\
to improve performance in blackout conditions.\
OPEN RESEARCH ISSUES\
The open key research issues regarding transport\
layer problems in the IPN Internet are as follows:\
Transport protocols for planetary nehvorks:\
The performance of the current transport layer\
solutions for terrestrial satellite, wireless ad hoc,\
and sensor networks, and the required modifications and improvements should he researched\
for planetary satellite and surface networks.\
Extreme interplanetary distances: Performance of the existing proposed solutions over\
the links with extreme distances, such as Jupiter\
and Pluto, that have intermittent connectivity\
within an RTT period needs to he evaluated,\
and proper modifications and improvements\
should be performed if necessary.\
End-to-end transport Extensive performance\
comparisons between end-to-end solutions and\
store-and-forward approaches should be performed. Furthermore, possible extensions of the\
existing proposed solutions and new adaptive\
transport protocols for end-to-end transport\
should be further investigated.\

IPN INTERNET APPLICATIONS\
The IPN Internet will provide communication\
services for scientific data delivery and navigation services for explorer spacccraft and orbitcrs\
of future deep space missions 121. Many of these\
future planetary missions, which will be pcrformed by the international space organizations\
such as NASA and European Space Agency\
(ESA), have already been scheduled for the next\
decade. Some of these missions are summarized\
along with their timelines and objectives in\
Table 1.\
As shown in Table I, all of these future space\
missions have a common objective of scientific\
data acquisition and delivery, which are also the\
main possible applications of the IPN Internet\
Time-Insensitive scientific data delivery: The\
main objective of thc IPN Internet is to realize\
communication between in-space entities allowing large volumes of scientific data to be collected from planets and moons.\
Time-sensitive scientific data delivery: This\
type of application is required to deliver great\
volumes of audio and visual information about\
the local environment to the Earth, in situ controlling robots, and eventually in situ astronauts\
Mission status telemetry: The status and\
health report of the mission, spacecraft, or landed vehicles could he delivered to the mission\
center or other nodes. This application requires\
periodic or event-driven unreliable transmission\
services.\
Command and control of in situ elements:\
The closed-loop command and control may\
involve indirect or multihop communication of\
remote nodes (the Earth station controls the\
mission rover on the planet surface) or close\
proximity nodes (the planetary orbit controls the\
lander).\
Thus far, these communication requirements\
['I:\
L11.\
of decp space missions have been addressed by\
NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN). However,\
it is clcar that the IPN lntcrnet is expected to\
extend current space communications cdpahilities to a point where the boundaries between\
terrestrial and space communications become\
transparent. The expcricnccs obtained from the\
DSN help us to undcrstand the unique challenges posed by deep space communication environments. Nevertheless, new communication\
technologies and novel networking protocols\
that address the challcnges and open research\
issues prcscnted earlier are yct to be developed\
for the realization of next-generation deep space\
Communications and hence the IPN lnternet\
objcctive.\
CONCLUSIONS\
The vision of futurc space exploration involves\
thc design and development of next-generation deep space networks, which are expected\
to be the Internet of the deep space planetary\
networks and defined as the IPN Internet.\
Howcver, there are significant challenges for\
the realization of this vision in several aspects\
of the communication architecture. In this\
article thcsc challenges and the current status\
of research efforts to address them are\
explored along with their shortcomings. As\
listed in Table 2, many researchcrs and several\
international research organizations are currently engaged in developing the required\
technologies to realize the IPN Internet.\
Despite a considerable amount of ongoing\
research in this direction, there still remain\
significantly challenging tasks for the research\
community to address before realization of the\
IPN Internet. We anticipate that this survey\
will serve as a building block for researchers\
around the world to motivate them to solve\
these challenging problems and help realize\
the IPN Internet. }{\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252\cocoartf2577

\f0\fs24 \cf0 SPACE WEATHER AND GPS SYSTEMS\
\
The use of single and dual frequency satellite radio navigation systems, like the Global Positioning System (GPS), has grown dramatically in the last decade. GPS receivers are now in nearly every cell phone and in many automobiles, trucks, and any equipment that moves and needs precision location measurements. High precision dual frequency GPS systems are used for farming, construction, exploration, surveying, snow removal and many other applications critical to a functional society. Other satellite navigation systems in orbit include the European Galileo system and the Russian GLONASS system.\
\
There are several ways in which space weather impacts GPS function. GPS radio signals travel from the satellite to the receiver on the ground, passing through the Earth\'92s ionosphere. The charged plasma of the ionosphere bends the path of the GPS radio signal similar to the way a lens bends the path of light. In the absence of space weather, GPS systems compensate for the \'93average\'94 or \'93quiet\'94  ionosphere, using a model to calculate its effect on the accuracy of the positioning information. But when the ionosphere is disturbed by a space weather event, the models are no longer accurate and the receivers are unable to calculate an accurate position based on the satellites overhead.\
\
In calm conditions, single frequency GPS systems can provide position information with an accuracy of a meter or less. During a severe space weather storm, these errors can increase to tens of meters or more. Dual frequency GPS systems can provide position information accurate to a few centimeters. In this case the two different GPS signals are used to better characterize the ionosphere and remove its impact on the position calculation. But when the ionosphere becomes highly disturbed, the GPS receiver cannot lock on the satellite signal and position information becomes inaccurate.\
\
Geomagnetic storms create large disturbances in the ionosphere. The currents and energy introduced by a geomagnetic storm enhance the ionosphere and increase the total height-integrated number of ionospheric electrons, or the Total Electron Count (TEC). GPS systems cannot correctly model this dynamic enhancement and errors are introduced into the position calculations. This usually occurs at high latitudes, though major storms can produce large TEC enhancements at mid-latitudes as well.\
\
Near the Earth\'92s magnetic equator there are current systems and electric fields that create instabilities in the ionosphere. The instabilities are most severe just after sunset. These smaller scale (tens of kilometers) instabilities, or bubbles, cause GPS signals to \'93scintillate\'94, much like waves on the surface of a body of water will disrupt and scatter the path of light as it passes through them. Near the equator, dual frequency GPS systems often lose their lock due to \'93ionospheric scintillation\'94. Ionospheric scintillations are not associated with any sort of space weather storm, but are simply part of the natural day-night cycle of the equatorial ionosphere.\
\
ELECTRIC POWER TRANSMISSION\
The electric power grid, and consequently the power to your home and business, can be disrupted by space weather.  One of the great discoveries of the 19th century was the realization that a time-varying magnetic field is able to produce an electrical current in a conducting wire.  The basic idea is that the time rate of change of the magnetic flux (i.e. lines of magnetic force) passing through a current loop is proportional to the current that is generated around the loop. A slightly earlier but equally important discovery was that a current-carrying wire produces a magnetic field.  The application of these principles is widely prevalent in modern society in electrical power generators, electrical power transformers, and electrical motors, for example.\
\
Time-varying magnetic fields and electrical current systems are not just artificial phenomena, but in fact are quite common in nature too.  Natural electrical current systems which vary in time can be found inside the Earth, in the oceans, and in the upper atmosphere of the earth (above ~100 km) where the constituents of the atmosphere include positively charged ions and negatively charged electrons which move about in a myriad of complicated ways.  Many of these upper atmospheric current systems are constantly present and modulate in a regular way in response to the rotation of the earth, the gravitational pull of the moon, and the slow variation of solar radiation over the course of the solar cycle.  At times, though, these current systems can be greatly enhanced and exhibit rapid changes with time and space, a phenomenon typically referred to as a geomagnetic storm.  Geomagnetic storms in turn are caused by disturbances that propagate away from the Sun, travel through interplanetary space and interact with Earth\'92s space environment.\
\
We might expect that the early inventors of the telegraph systems did not realize that the electrical circuit they were constructing was threaded by lines of naturally produced magnetic flux, and, even more surprising, that this flux could vary with time and induce a natural current in their system.  It was not too long after their deployment, though, that reports of anomalous currents were observed which could at times prohibit communication or could enable a system to be run without an electrical power source, or in more dramatic instances cause the recording paper to catch fire (see review by Boteler 2003 and references therein).  Similar effects continued to be noticed from time to time with the next generation of communication lines (coaxial cables).\
\
Another system of artificial electrical circuits began to grow with the advent of electrical power systems. Just like the telegraphs, this complicated collection of circuits is threaded by naturally produced magnetic flux and just like the telegraphs, rapid variations of this magnetic flux during geomagnetic storms causes a naturally produced current to flow through the system.  This effect was first reported after the 24 March 1940 geomagnetic storm (Davidson, 1940; see also Germaine, 1940 for reports of effects on long-line communication cables).  Numerous large and moderate impacts to the grid have been reported over the years, including a power blackout in 1958 (Lanzerotti & Gregori, 1986), equipment tripping and voltage stability issues (4 August 1972), a nine-hour blackout in Canada and a transformer loss (13 March 1989 - see photo), and a blackout in Sweden during the October 2003 storm. (See Boteler, 2001, for a comprehensive compilation of effects).\
\
Assessing the impact of geomagnetic storms on the electrical power grid involves a number of considerations.  The path for current flow that responds to the varying external currents in the upper atmosphere follows artificial current paths on the ground (the power lines) as well as various natural current paths (e.g. conducting structures below the ground and nearby bodies of water).  Once the natural current paths are accounted for, the net geoelectric field that is imposed on the artificial current paths results in a quasi D.C. (periods of 10 seconds to 10\'92s (tens) of minutes) current in the power lines.  These geomagnetically induced currents cause the \'91exciting current\'92 in power transformers to operate out of their designed range, resulting in saturation of the magnetic core material inside the transformer.  Once the core saturates, the transformer no longer provides any back \'91electromotive force\'92 (a kind of electrical inertia) and the currents and voltages in the windings become abnormally large. Depending on the transformer design, this can lead to heating of the surrounding structures due to induced \'91Eddy Currents\'92 which has the potential to damage parts of the transformer.  An additional impact of transformer saturation is that the voltages and currents no longer have a simple sinusoidal (60 cycle) form and this can cause protective equipment elsewhere in the grid to trip when it shouldn\'92t.  These equipment \'91trips\'92 can take needed equipment off line and cause voltage stability problems.  An additional issue for the system is that all of the transformers that are saturating show up as a significant inductive load on the grid as a whole.  This means that a system that is near peak levels of demand prior to the geomagnetic storm event may not be able to meet the total power demand when the geomagnetic storm occurs, leading to partial or system wide blackouts.\
\
HF RADIO COMMUNICATIONS\
Space weather impacts radio communication in a number of ways. At frequencies in the 1 to 30 mega Hertz range (known as \'93High Frequency\'94 or HF radio), the changes in ionospheric density and structure modify the transmission path and even block transmission of HF radio signals completely. These frequencies are used by amateur (ham) radio operators and many industries such as commercial airlines. They are also used by a number of government agencies such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Defense.\
\
There are several types of space weather that can impact HF radio communication. In a typical sequence of space weather storms, the first impacts are felt during the solar flare itself. The solar x-rays from the sun penetrate to the bottom of the ionosphere (to around 80 km). There the x-ray photons ionize the atmosphere and create an enhancement of the D layer of the ionosphere. This enhanced D-layer acts both as a reflector of radio waves at some frequencies and an absorber of waves at other frequencies. The Radio Blackout associated with solar flares occurs on the dayside region of Earth and is most intense when the sun is directly overhead.\
\
Another type of space weather, the Radiation Storm caused by energetic solar protons, can also disrupt HF radio communication. The protons are guided by Earth\'92s magnetic field such that they collide with the upper atmosphere near the north and south poles. The fast-moving protons have an affect similar to the x-ray photons and create an enhanced D-Layer thus blocking HF radio communication at high latitudes. During auroral displays, the precipitating electrons can enhance other layers of the ionosphere and have similar disrupting and blocking effects on radio communication. This occurs mostly on the night side of the polar regions of Earth where the aurora is most intense and most frequent.\
\
SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS\
Satellite communication refers to any communication link that involves the use of an artificial satellite in its propagation path. Satellite communications play a vital role in modern life. There are over 2000 artificial satellites in use. They can be found in geostationary, Molniya, elliptical, and low Earth orbits and are used for traditional point-to-point communications, mobile applications, and the distribution of TV and radio programs. For a brief history of satellite communications see: http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/524891/satellite-communication.(link is external) For details on communication satellite orbits and satellite communication applications see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_satellite(link is external).\
\
Satellite communications tend to use high frequency signals: Ultra High Frequency (UHF), 300 MHz - 3 GHz and Super High Frequency (SHF), 3 - 30 GHz. Radio signals propagating to and from a satellite in orbit are affected by the environmental conditions along the propagation path. In a vacuum, radio signals propagate at the speed of light, but in the presence of plasma in the ionosphere, the signals are affected by group delay and phase advance and attenuation due to absorption and scintillation. The environment's effect on the signal is frequency dependent and to a first approximation is proportional to the amount of structure in the plasma present along the propagation path.\
\
Due to ionospheric variability (Space Weather), the effects on propagating signals are highly variable. Up to some level, the effects of Space Weather on propagation can be mitigated through engineering design solutions, but space weather can lead to a total loss of communication due to attenuation and/or severe scintillation when the broadcast signals cross the ionosphere. In trans-ionosphere propagation, scintillation refers to the rapid variation of the amplitude and phase of a received signal. Scintillation is produced by structure in the ionosphere. The severity of scintillation depends on the frequency of the used signal and the spatial structure of plasma density and plasma drifts along the propagation path. Specifically, scintillation at the receiver is produced by constructive and destructive interference of refracted and diffracted components of the broadcast signal.\
\
SATELLITE DRAG\
Drag is a force exerted on an object moving through a fluid, and it is oriented in the direction of relative fluid flow. Drag acts opposite to the direction of motion and tends to slow an object. As an example, think of running against a high wind and feeling the drag pushing you back in the direction of relative fluid flow. This same force acts on spacecraft and objects flying in the space environment. Drag has a significant impact on spacecraft in low Earth orbit (LEO), generally defined as an orbit below an altitude of approximately 2,000 kilometers (1,200 mi). Although the air density is much lower than near the Earth\'92s surface, the air resistance in those layers of the atmosphere where satellites in LEO travel is still strong enough to produce drag and pull them closer to the Earth (Figure 1, shown above, the region of the Earth\'92s atmosphere where atmospheric drag is an important factor perturbing spacecraft orbits.(NASA/GSFC)). The International Space Station (ISS) and the Hubble Space Telescope are examples of spacecraft operating in LEO.\
\
The drag force on satellites increases during times when the Sun is active. When the Sun adds extra energy the atmosphere the low density layers of air at LEO altitudes rise and are replaced by higher density layers that were previously at lower altitudes. As a result, the spacecraft now flies through the higher density layer and experiences a stronger drag force. When the Sun is quiet, satellites in LEO have to boost their orbits about four times per year to make up for atmospheric drag. When solar activity is at its greatest over the 11-year solar cycle, satellites may have to be maneuvered every 2-3 weeks to maintain their orbit [1].\
\
In addition to these long-term changes in upper atmospheric temperature and density caused by the solar cycle, interactions between the solar wind and the Earth\'92s magnetic field during geomagnetic storms can produce large short-term increases in upper atmosphere temperature and density, increasing drag on satellites and changing their orbits. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) has to re-identify hundreds of objects and record their new orbits after a large solar storm event (Figure 2). During the March 1989 storm event, for example, the NASA's Solar Maximum Mission (SMM) spacecraft was reported to have "dropped as if it hit a brick wall" due to the increased atmospheric drag.\

\f0\fs24 \cf0 The Interplanetary Internet\
NASA researchers quarrel over how to network outer space\
\
\
illustration of planetary network.\
Illustration: Bryan Christie\
The era of networked space communications is slowly dawning across NASA. Up until now, sending commands to a lonely ship was simply a matter of shooting off a radio signal when its antenna came within range. A simple matter, that is, after telecommunications software written precisely for that one specific mission had been painstakingly fashioned. Afterward, that software was usually discarded. For the next mission, unique software was crafted all over again.\
\
Here\'92s an idea: why doesn\'92t NASA put a network in the sky, with each orbiter, rover, space-borne telescope, and any other skyward-launched device working as a node? Why not internetwork space? In fact, why not use the existing Internet?\
\
Over the next several decades, as we embark on the next stage of the Internet\'92s spread into our solar system, scientists will need to manipulate sophisticated experimental instruments on space stations and exchange vast streams of data with colleagues living on the moon and, eventually, Mars. The network that NASA will soon build could very well be the one over which scientists work out startling details of Martian geology, oceanic conditions under the ice of Jupiter\'92s frigid moon Europa, or the turbulent cloud cover of Venus. It may well be the way a homesick space explorer sends e-mail back home.\
\
If there were network links to remote probes, scientists could dial in to them as easily as they check the latest CNN.com headlines. All the information generated aboard these vehicles and habitats, from humdrum experiments growing crystals in zero gravity to data showing the existence of fossils of ancient microbes, could come in via a single network extending through the vacuum of space\'97not just from NASA, but from the European Space Agency, China\'92s National Space Administration, and other organizations as well. So as we move from space discovery to exploration, and perhaps even extraterrestrial settlements, space engineers have begun to radically rethink how mission controllers could best communicate with Earth\'92s far-flung emissaries.\
\
Everyone at NASA agrees that extending the Internet to other planets would be ideal. Whether it\'92s possible, however, and how, has become a source of fractious contention within the agency. Two different cliques have very different ideas about how this should be done.\
\
One team of very smart researchers, most of them working at the Goddard Space Flight Center, in Greenbelt, Md. [see photo, ], is testing ways to use the basic networking protocols that run the Internet. That would let space scientists use all the tools they use on Earth today: Web browsers, file-transfer software, and so on. Using off-the-shelf hardware, as well as reusing existing earthbound software, would save money and development time.\
\
As enthusiastic as these researchers are, another group within NASA has concluded that using Internet protocols in space\'97at least in deep space\'97will never work. Like the Goddard group, this camp has some very smart people on its side, including, surprisingly enough, Vinton G. Cerf, an IEEE Fellow who helped write the Internet protocols still used by the billions of computers and other devices on the Internet. According to Cerf and these other NASA researchers, Internet-style chatting with a shuttle 600 kilometers away may be easy enough, but wirelessly conversing with, say, Mars-orbiting craft 200 million km away is an essentially impossible challenge.\
\
What started as a theoretical dispute within NASA is now a practical one, with a hard timetable. In January 2004, the Bush administration announced an ambitious new mission for NASA. It includes a successor to the space shuttles, called the Crew Exploration Vehicle, which is to run its first manned mission in 2014. Also in line are a series of robotic missions to the moon, beginning in 2008.\
\
Once made, a protocol decision may have a lifetime longer than Pluto\'92s year. The current Internet protocols are based on principles Cerf sketched out on the back of an envelope more than 30 years ago in a San Francisco hotel lobby. NASA has about a year to make network architecture choices that could bind the solar system for decades to come.\
\
Engineers at NASA\'92s Goddard Space Flight Center thought they had proven that Internet protocols could be extended into outer space in a February 2003 Columbia shuttle experiment. Sadly, that mission was Columbia\'92s last. Four days later, the spaceship came apart over Texas during reentry.\
\
Earlier in that mission, the NASA engineers had transferred a file between Goddard and the shuttle, which was soaring almost 600 km above Earth. It was the first time that a file from outer space made its way back to a terrestrial command center without having its route set ahead of time. To receive that small but historic transmission, technicians had to orchestrate things so that the communications link with the orbiting spacecraft was handed off, like a cellphone transmission, from one ground station to the next. In other words, the equipment on the Columbia handed the data over to the network, and the network delivered the data to its destination.\
\
The experiment was called CANDOS, for Communication and Navigation Demonstration on Shuttle. It had been a long time coming for Goddard engineer Keith Hogie, whose wire-rim glasses, mop-top haircut, and generally youthful demeanor belie his 54 years. Since the mid-1970s, the lanky engineer has been writing one complicated software program after another, all to do more or less the same thing\'97download and sort telemetry and other data. Each program worked with a unique piece of hardware, so it had to be written from scratch. But, fortunately for Hogie, a lot of the communications protocols he wrote were pretty generic.\
\
After reinventing this wheel at least four times by the early 1990s, Hogie came to understand the power of the Internet Protocol. IP is the lingua franca for data communications. It\'92s not just the way bits are packaged for transmission on the Internet but also how they are routed from machine to machine. As happens all the time on the Internet, two computer systems using wildly different hardware\'97a Hewlett-Packard PDA and an IBM mainframe, say\'97can pass the data back and forth, so long as they both speak IP.\
\
For Hogie and the rest of NASA\'92s telecommunications programmers, IP promises to greatly reduce the number of hours spent ensuring that NASA\'92s diverse spacecraft can communicate with one another and with ground stations. If NASA were to adopt a common platform, along with standards on how data should be formatted, missions could use off-the-shelf communications software packages rather than requiring people like Hogie to write new ones. The success of the Internet over the past two decades has led to some assumptions about how data communications would work everywhere. On Earth, the Internet passes information in the form of data packets, whose bits may represent a Web page or an e-mail. Messages seem to flit from place to place instantaneously.\
\
That isn\'92t true in space. Message speed is capped by the speed of light, a limitation unnoticeable here but obvious out in space. It takes over a second for light to travel to the moon; light from Mars takes anywhere from 3 to 15 minutes to reach Earth, depending on the two planets\'92 positions. Hopping through relay satellites, as most transmissions do, might double the transit time. As it turns out, those kinds of delays would doom a space connection using the standard protocols that govern Internet communication, because they require that the sending computer get a confirmation from the recipient machine that each data packet has been received.\
\
IP doesn\'92t include a mechanism to ensure that packets arrive at their destination, so it\'92s never used by itself. Almost all Internet communication uses a second protocol as well, the Transmission Control Protocol, or TCP. Cerf and a colleague, Robert Kahn, introduced the pair in a paper in the May 1974 issue of IEEE Transactions on Communications. Telecommunications protocols are usually thought of as being stacked on top of one another, and in Cerf and Kahn\'92s scheme, IP lies near the bottom of the stack, just above the physical connection between two devices (cables, radio waves, and so on). TCP operates at the next layer up.\
\
On the Internet, TCP ensures a communications link between two parties by setting up a stream of acknowledgments between them. The receiving computer sends a receipt for each set of packets it gets. If the sending computer doesn\'92t get these acknowledgments promptly, it assumes the network is congested and slows down the transmission rate, eventually resending the packets it hasn\'92t heard back about. TCP made the Internet what it is today\'97always busy but almost never congested to the point of collapse.\
\
The file transfer from the Columbia on that cold night in 2003 was not NASA\'92s first attempt at extending TCP/IP into the heavens. Spacecraft had made simple connections with Earth, using Internet protocols, several times before. These experiments worked well, but they skirted another major challenge of space communications via Internet protocols: the need to go through multiple ground stations, and the handing-off difficulties this inevitably entailed. As the world rotates on its axis, only a few of the many ground stations scattered around the globe can communicate with an individual spacecraft, itself in motion. Relay satellites can improve a communications link with a ground station, as they remain in line of sight with the craft for longer periods of time. But the problem remains: to get a command to a spacecraft, a control center needs to know which ground station has a \'93view\'94 of the craft at any given time.\
\
So NASA planners painstakingly calculate ahead of time which ground station their craft can contact at any given moment. The chore involves writing out a timetable of sorts, either on a computer or on a whiteboard. With a craft\'92s scheduled trajectory in hand, the NASA personnel calculate when it will be in contact with each ground station and schedule a communication session through that particular station. This is work that will grow ever more tedious as NASA puts more craft in flight. Wouldn\'92t it be great to automate it?\
\
CANDOS showed how Internet technologies could help. On Earth, messages and Web pages don\'92t travel by precalculated routes. Data are packaged and then volleyed over the Internet by a series of routers\'97devices that relay packets from one network to another. A router examines the destination of a packet and then forwards it to a connecting router, based on two factors\'97which routers are closer to that packet\'92s ultimate destination and which paths have the most bandwidth available at the moment.\

Beyond the Internet Protocol: Scott Burleigh is one of several engineers at NASA\'92s Jet Propulsion Lab who think today\'92s Internet protocols need to be supplemented with new ones to network remote space.\
On Earth, Internet servers (the machines that store Web pages, e-mail, and other data) sit in offices and data centers, as do routers. In space, though, satellites, probes, and other vehicles will have to act as their own servers, and they will always be on the move. So CANDOS tested a new protocol, called Mobile IP. Developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (an influential volunteer group that sets Internet standards), Mobile IP allows servers to roam through space and still be reached.\
\
NASA\'92s scattered ground stations are positioned so that a spacecraft can always be in contact with one of them. So for Goddard\'92s experiment, the team set up routers at ground stations on the island of Guam and at three U.S. locations: White Sands, N.M.; Wallops Island, Va.; and Merritt Island, Fla. The Goddard facility, near Washington, D.C., connected to these routers through an internal NASA network. That done, it could communicate with the shuttle regardless of where it was in orbit or which ground station happened to have the shuttle in sight [see diagram, ].\
\
To prove how powerful this concept of using IP in space could be, the Goddard team set up a log-in account\'97a user name and a password\'97for some colleagues at the Marshall Space Flight Center, in Huntsville, Ala., so they, too, could access the ill-fated shuttle\'92s computer. Without a standard TCP/IP connection, Marshall might have had to commission someone like Hogie to write the software that would make the connections to give access to its engineers. But with TCP/IP, accessing the shuttle was as easy as using an AOL account. Once logged on, technicians could upload or download files, check the logs to see how the onboard server was running, or do anything else the staff at Goddard could do.\
\
The CANDOS trial was so successful that NASA engineers are starting to incorporate some of its technology into the agency\'92s existing communication networks. CANDOS project manager David Israel and his team are working on something they call NASA Space Network IP Services, based on a set of permanent routers placed at NASA ground stations that will offer researchers the same IP connections that the Goddard and Marshall teams enjoyed. By 2007, these services will allow mission teams to turn their spacecraft into additional network nodes. Researchers on Earth will be able to manipulate onboard instruments, monitor the craft\'92s well-being, and perhaps even route another spacecraft\'92s data through it.\
\
That assumes, of course, that these spacecraft will run Internet software and use Internet protocols in deep space. And that\'92s something that will happen only if Goddard engineers can conquer the vociferous doubts of a team at NASA\'92s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\

IP Everywhere: Engineers at NASA\'92s Goddard Space Flight Center think existing Internet protocols can be extended deep into space. From left: Jim Rash, Keith Hogie, and David Israel.\
Literally and figuratively, CANDOS took only a baby step, the dissenters at JPL say. It proved little. The 600 kilometers between Earth and a near-Earth orbiting space shuttle doesn\'92t even measure up to the distance between Paris and Prague; countless packets travel much farther than that every minute of every day. The question remains: just how far into space can the Internet Protocol reasonably go?\
\
At NASA\'92s JPL, in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, near Pasadena, Calif., doubts about IP\'92s suitability in space began in the early 1990s. Run by the California Institute of Technology, JPL plans, designs, and controls deep-space missions for NASA. The Mars rovers are JPL\'92s handiwork, as is the Cassini space probe now orbiting Saturn.\
\
Like the engineers at Goddard, JPL researchers were interested in using IP to standardize telecommunications throughout the solar system. But the more they tried to shoehorn IP into the task, the more they came to doubt its practicality for deep space.\
\
Why? The JPL researchers looked at the same basic obstacles\'97the handoff problem and the distance-delay problem. But where the Goddard group saw surmountable obstacles, the JPL engineers\'97including \'93Mr. IP\'94 Cerf\'97saw showstoppers. Take the delay problem: the JPL crew found that no matter how they tried to readjust TCP for deep-space travel, it would not work. \'93Remote control is very hard when you have a 40-minute round-trip time,\'94 says Cerf.\
\
JPL senior staffer Adrian Hooke, along with engineers Robert Durst and Keith Scott from the nonprofit organization Mitre Corp., started work in 1997 on a set of IP-based standards to address these problems. In 1998, Cerf started helping Hooke\'92s team. By then, the group had been through four iterations of a modified set of Internet protocols. They all involved modifying TCP so that it would not rely on the sender and final receiver\'92s being in constant contact.\
\
In 2002, a member of the JPL team, Kevin Fall, a researcher for Intel Corp.\'92s Berkeley Research Lab, came up with the term Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) to describe the architecture that would be needed to address this sort of problem. The Interplanetary Internet Working Group rebranded itself the Delay Tolerant Networking Research Group and began working on drafts, submitted to the Internet Research Task Force, to describe how such a network should operate. Fall now leads the group.\
\
A delay-tolerant network is designed to move data across rough networks\'97networks that have long delays and noisy connections. Central to Fall\'92s concept of DTN is \'93bundling,\'94 a mechanism for a space network\'92s nodes\'97probes, relay satellites, and the like\'97to hold data if the next hop in the network is unavailable. Communications specialists call this a store-and-forward network.\
\
This approach contrasts greatly with how nodes handle data on the TCP/IP-driven Internet. An Internet router doesn\'92t keep track of the packets it conveys, nor where they are going beyond the next hop. Only the computer at the endpoint of all this hopping knows that a packet has arrived (and sends the acknowledgment back through the entire chain).\
\
A DTN router, in contrast, keeps a copy of every packet of data sent, at least until the next node has sent a message that it has received it. That scheme ensures that no data gets lost en route, even if a node is offline. Should a relay satellite along an interplanetary Internet slip behind the other side of a moon, a router on a DTN network would simply hold onto the data that needed to be transmitted until that satellite reappeared, or until another one came into position to provide the necessary hop.\

The NASA Net: In February 2003, engineers at NASA\'92s Goddard Space Flight Center used the Columbia shuttle and a number of ground stations and communications satellites to demonstrate that the Internet Protocol could be used to communicate with spacecraft, at least at near-Earth distances.\

Bank Shot:  A space network would allow scientists anywhere on Earth to interact with, say, a Venusian probe. Since space communications requires a line of sight between two points, if the sun is between Earth and Venus, the network could route data through another satellite, such as one near Mars\'97like banking a shot on a billiard table.\
While the new protocol is hugely inefficient by earthly standards, using up a lot of memory to hold duplicate copies of data and needing orders of magnitude more time to send complete messages, it is a surefire way to get data to its destination. And it has some other benefits for a device in outer space, which, after all, has other things to worry about besides communicating with Earth.\
\
Suppose a robotic surveyor on Mars has to navigate harsh terrain, looking for rocks that might contain fossils, and then send new photos of them back to Earth\'97a 10- to 12-minute trip at best. If it were a node on a TCP/IP network, the robot would have to keep a copy of that data in its limited memory banks until it got a confirmation that the data had been received on Earth. Such a notice would take at least 20 minutes to arrive\'97more if a direct connection weren\'92t available. DTN, on the other hand, would require the surveyor to keep the data only until they were received by the first node\'97probably a nearby relay satellite. The surveyor could empty its memory banks and go back to snapping more photos within seconds.\
\
In December, the JPL team submitted a draft for a DTN-supporting protocol called the Licklider Transmission Protocol, named in honor of Internet pioneer J.C.R. Licklider. (In 1962, Licklider jokingly nicknamed a group of researchers he was working with the \'93Intergalactic Computer Network.\'94) The Licklider Transmission Protocol would replace both IP and TCP. Once again, picturing protocols as layers in a stack, if the bottom layer is the physical wire line or radio wave connecting two devices, the Licklider Transmission Protocol sits just above that. It makes the link between two routers more reliable than IP and TCP, says JPL researcher Scott Burleigh, who coauthored the draft.\
\
The fact that DTN Eschews IP bothers some at Goddard and elsewhere in the NASA realm. You can hear the rumblings of discontent, if only in small groups huddled at space communications conferences or in cryptically snippy e-mails posted to technical mailing lists.\
\
\'93There\'92s been resistance to the idea of not using IP everywhere really from the beginning,\'94 JPL\'92s Burleigh acknowledges. No one at NASA disputes the science behind DTN, not even its critics at Goddard. Not when Cerf, who could be expected to defend IP tenaciously, is on the JPL team. As CANDOS\'92s Israel concedes, \'93You can\'92t really say those guys don\'92t know what they are talking about.\'94\
\
The Goddard concern basically boils down to this: if NASA were to choose DTN as the single architecture for its space missions, it could very well miss out on the opportunity to reuse commercially developed Internet software and hardware. It would in effect be prolonging its decades-old reliance on specialized products that cost far more or have fewer features (or both). With so much money and operability at stake, working with some version of IP is long overdue, these researchers say.\
\
Consider President Bush\'92s plans for a moon base and an eventual mission to Mars. It calls for coordinating the activities of multiple systems and habitats\'97robots that explore planets, way stations on the moon, relay satellites that orbit planets. It cries out for an IP-based networked approach to managing communications, Goddard specialists say, adding that commercial IP could help cut costs dramatically. It would also allow scientists to run many Internet applications that DTN would render unusable. While DTN can work with IP for some things, such as file transfers, using DTN to connect two IP networks\'97one in space and another on Earth, for instance\'97breaks the end-to-end connectivity essential for running many other Internet applications.\
\
One such set of applications involves the interfaces that control scientific instruments. Today, scientists usually have to write by hand the programs that control the instruments that carry out their experiments aboard space probes. Researchers at the NASA Glenn Research Center, in Cleveland, have developed software tools that allow scientists to place a small Web server on each instrument. Then, with a space-based IP network, the scientists would need only a Web browser on a computer to tap into that instrument\'97in principle, from any network connection: a university laboratory, home, or a Starbucks coffee shop. With a DTN network, on the other hand, there would be no end-to-end Internet connection all the way to the instrument, rendering it useless.\
\
Then there\'92s the cost issue. Consider, for example, security software, needed so that hackers can\'92t invade NASA\'92s systems and take multimillion-dollar space probes on remote-controlled interplanetary joy rides. Such software is expensive to create but, for standard IP applications, easily purchased nowadays.\
\
Over the years, researchers have carefully designed stripped-down security software for spacecraft communications that wraps a packet with a very thin envelope, reducing to a minimum the total number of bytes of data needed to send a photo or other information. The data savings, though, have to be weighed against the fact that a specialized solution is expensive to implement, maintain, and update, given the tiny number of vendors, compared with the commercial Internet equivalent, IPSec.\
\
But what about the long transmission times and other challenges of space communications? At least two techniques exist for dealing with dodgy connectivity, the IP-in-space advocates say. One is the User Datagram Protocol, or UDP, which is similar to TCP but sends packets out without requiring receipts. It\'92s been used for years in applications such as streaming media, where losing a packet here and there is much less important than keeping up with a high-speed data exchange. In fact, the CANDOS experiment aboard the shuttle used a version of UDP, called Multicast Dissemination Protocol.\
\
Another model is provided by a store-and-forward network millions of us use every day\'97the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, in which a server holds e-mail until we retrieve it. Phil Paulsen, who manages the earth science technology office at the Glenn Research Center, was part of a NASA team that developed, with General Dynamics Corp., store-and-forward software specifically for space communications.\
\
\'93We assumed that there would be these kinds of satellites where you do not have continuous connectivity,\'94 Paulsen says. The best thing about the software? It runs over IP. But like Goddard\'92s Mobile IP, it has been tested only in near-Earth orbits. No one has even done the basic math to calculate if such an approach can be extended for millions of kilometers.\
\
For his part, Cerf isn\'92t swayed. \'93They mystify me,\'94 he says of DTN\'92s detractors, and generally of those who insist ordinary Internet protocols can be used in space. \'93My opinion is that you can\'92t tweak the protocols enough to make them useful and still be compatible.\'94\
\
Sure, these specialists understand terrestrial Internet technologies fiendishly well. What they don\'92t get, Cerf says, is the \'93space\'94 aspect of space communications. Space will befuddle earthbound protocols in ways most network experts rarely conceive of.\
\
Timing, for instance. Internet routers around the globe synchronize their clocks by the millisecond in order to coordinate the flow of packets. That synchronization is far more difficult when a significant fraction of a light-year separates a spacecraft\'92s onboard clock from its reference clock. \'93The problem with the interplanetary environment is that there ain\'92t no such thing as \'91now,\'92\'94 Cerf says.\
\
Power, a limited resource on all NASA equipment, is another issue. Can TCP or some other protocol be tweaked so that it gets less chatty, and therefore less power-hungry, when a craft\'92s fuel cells run down? The JPL team doesn\'92t think so.\
\
IP everywhere or not? For outsiders, such emotional differences in philosophy may seem like a NASA divided. For the space agency, however, it\'92s just good science: have researchers beat on a problem from different angles and let the best solution win out.\
\
Sitting quietly on the sidelines, waiting to evaluate all this work, are the NASA architects who must design the ambitious space fleet President Bush envisions. Over the next year, NASA\'92s Space Communications Architecture Working Group will start planning the basic communications design for the Crew Exploration Vehicle. \'93Our job with technology is to figure out where it fits in with the evolving architecture,\'94 says its chairman, John Rush.\
\
Rush has heard from both sides of the IP debate. He admits to liking the IP folks\'92 idea of \'93the scientist sitting in his laboratory and communicating with his instruments on a spacecraft.\'94 But he\'92s also well aware of the challenges. Over the next 10 months, JPL, Goddard, and Glenn will make their cases to the working group, through presentations and white papers.\
\
One thing is certain: NASA is moving toward a networked model of interplanetary communications. Long gone are the days of dedicating a communications link to any one craft. The question now is how to build a network for a sky full of orbiters, shuttles, surveyors, and other spacecraft\'97the equipment that will be our eyes and ears to the universe. We want to make sure we get the best view possible.}{\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252\cocoartf2577

\f0\fs24 \cf0 Future Architecture of the Interplanetary Internet\
\
Abstract\'97Fifty years after the Apollo program, space exploration has recently been regaining popularity thanks to missions\
with high media coverage. Future space exploration and space\
station missions will require specific networks to interconnect\
Earth with other objects and planets in the solar system. The\
interconnections of these networks form the core of an Interplanetary Internet (IPN). More specifically, we consider the IPN as the\
combination of physical infrastructure, network architecture, and\
technologies to provide communication and navigation services\
for missions and further applications. Compared to the current\
implementation of the Internet, nodes composing the core of the\
IPN are highly heterogeneous (base stations on planets, satellites\
etc.). Moreover, nodes are in constant motion over intersecting\
elliptical planes, which results in highly variable delays and even\
temporary unavailability of parts of the network. As such, an\
IPN has to overcome the challenges of conventional opportunistic\
networks, with much higher latency and jitter (from a couple\
of minutes to several days) and the additional constraint of\
long-term autonomous operations. In this paper, we highlight\
the challenges of IPN, demonstrate the elements to deploy\
within the areas of interest, and propose the technologies to\
handle deep space communication. We provide recommendations\
for an evolutionary IPN implementation, coherent with specific\
milestones of space exploration.\
I. INTRODUCTION\
Exploring the world beyond its physical boundaries is one\
of humanity\'92s oldest dreams. In recent years, space exploration\
has not only been feeding human curiosity, but also allowed for\
scientific advancement in environmental research, and to find\
natural resources [1]\'96[3]. Although media exposure reached\
its peak during the Apollo programs, space research remains\
a very active domain, with new exploration and observation\
missions launched every year.\
Following the Apollo program, NASA launched Voyager 1\
and 2 in 1977 [4]\'96[6] to explore Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and\
Neptune. In September 2007, Voyager 1 crossed the termination shock (where the speed of the solar wind drops below the\
speed of sound) at 84 AU which is more than twice the distance\
to Pluto. The Voyager Interstellar Mission (VIM), an extension\
to the 1977 Voyager mission, will explore the outermost\
edge of the Sun\'92s domain and beyond. Regarding nearby\
planets, NASA\'92s twin robot geologists, the Mars Exploration\
Rovers (MER), landed on Mars in 2004 to perform on-site\
geological investigations, joined by NASA\'92s Mars Curiosity\
Rover in 2012 [7]. Currently, 6 active satellites orbit around\
Mars, with primary purpose of studying the atmosphere, relay\
data for other missions such as the Mars rovers, or test key\

technologies for interplanetary exploration [8]\'96[13]. Deep\
Impact mission is another mission by NASA which began in\
2005 on comet Tempel 1 to expose materials on its surface\
[14]. Private companies are also starting to take part in space\
exploration. In 2012, Red Bull sent the Stratos capsule into\
the stratosphere, which allowed detailed study of the effect of\
breaking the sound barrier on a human body. SpaceX and Blue\
Origin were founded with main objective to reduce the cost\
and increase the safety of space flight. Finally, NASA recently\
contracted Boeing to transport astronauts to the International\
Space Station (ISS) [15].\
In recent years, both space agencies and private companies\
managed to attract a lot of media attention on ongoing and\
future space missions, resulting in a clear regain of interest\
of the public for space exploration. Figure 1 presents several\
missions with high media coverage. From left to right: Philae\
landing on the comet Rosetta, the Red Bull Stratos capsule,\
and New Horizon approaching Pluto. As a consequence of\
this regain of interest, space agencies started to plan several\
ambitious missions over the 22nd century. The geographic\
proximity of Mars to Earth, associated with advances of\
technology enable to envision sending manned missions in the\
next decades. NASA [16] is planning round trips to Mars by\
2030, while the Mars One project aims at setting a colony\
by 2032 [17]. Finally, in a recent declaration, Elon Musk\
announced that SpaceX\'92s goal is to send the first humans\
to mars by 2024 [18]. Several unmanned missions are also\
planned in upcoming years: new Mars rovers, the James Webb\

Space Telescope, and even the Asteroid Redirect Robotic\
Mission(ARRM), a robotic mission to visit a large near-Earth\
asteroid, collect a multi-ton boulder from its surface, and\
redirect it into stable orbit around the Moon [19].\
Such missions require a reliable, scalable and easy to deploy\
common communication infrastructure to transmit scientific\
data from outer space to the earth and back. The advantages\
of such strategy are manifold:\
\'95 Interoperability: multiple organizations are currently\
sending spacecrafts in near or deep space. A common\
infrastructure would significantly reduce the cost of communication, while facilitating inter-agency cooperations.\
Both manned and unmanned missions would benefit from\
sharing resources, as it is done currently on the Internet,\
rather than multiplying parallel incompatible networks.\
\'95 Security: The proliferation of communication systems\
considerably increases the risk of failure. Due to their critical nature, space communication systems present a high\
need for redundancy and security. A common network\
architecture would enable organizations to work together\
towards a reliable and secure infrastructure.\
\'95 Increased bandwidth: New Horizon\'92s high-resolution\
pictures of Pluto were a huge success [20], participating\
in the general public\'92s regain of interest in space exploration. To keep this interest going, future missions will\
require higher bandwidth to continue providing data to\
the general audience.\
\'95 Scalability: Space exploration is an incremental process.\
If we look at Mars exploration, it started with several\
probes taking pictures, followed by the launch of satellites, and finally robots. Each of these steps requires\
increasing communication resources. Therefore, it makes\
more sense to progressively scale up the network than\
deploying all the resources for future missions at once.\
\'95 Colonies: A round trip to Mars would take 18 months, requiring the astronauts to remain 3 months on Mars, waiting for optimal conditions for the return trip [21]. Several\
organizations even envision definitive Mars colonies. Interconnecting both planets networks would facilitate the\
expansion of human knowledge and culture.\
In this article, we propose a future Interplanetary Internet\
(IPN) [22] architecture. Such an architecture interconnects\
networks from various organizations to form a unified network,\
itself connected to the current Earth Internet. In the long run,\
an IPN architecture also facilitates the network expansion.\
With the IPN Internet being the future Internet that interconnects the solar system, and potentially beyond, we focus\
on the aspects and challenges involved in such infrastructure.\
We propose an effective infrastructure aligned with existing\
technologies to cope with the foreseen challenges, and reliable\
protocols to provide autonomous data delivery from an area\
of interest (planet, Moon) to the Earth and back.\
Throughout this paper, we follow a bottom-up approach,\
from the transmission channel to our proposed architecture.\
After a quick recap of related work towards an IPN in\
Section II, we introduce the characteristics of the medium\
and study the opportunities for transmission in Section III. We\
then review the existing infrastructures that can be used in our\
architecture in Section IV. We finally propose an evolutionary\
architecture for Interplanetary Internet in Section V.\
II. RELATED WORK\
The IPN describes the set of communication services for\
scientific data delivery and the navigation services for exploration spacecrafts and orbiters [23], [24]. As the IPN is still in\
its incubation stage, its architecture and infrastructure should\
be carefully planned; a considerable amount of common standards and research is required to reach an agreement between\
organizations and cope with the high deployment costs [25].\
The Jet Proportion Laboratory (JPL) deployed the first DTN\
Gateway located about 25 million kilometers from the Earth\
during the \'94Deep Impact Network Experiment (DINET)\'94\
[26], [27]. During this experiment, about 300 images were\
transmitted from the JPL nodes to the spacecraft. These images\
were then automatically forwarded back to the JPL. NASA\
and JPL have started implementing technologies such as the\
deep space network (DSN), which consists of an array of\
antennas to cover the whole solar system and terminals for\
optical communication [28], [29]. This network was notably\
used to retransmit the images of the first moonwalk.\
NASA has also conducted studies to provide a common infrastructure for forthcoming space missions. Bhasin et al. [30]\
propose a scalable communication architecture to maximize\
data delivery and provide capabilities to send high volumes\
of data (> 100Mb). This architecture provides high bandwidth\
communication for further scientific missions. In this study, the\
authors define the requirements to achieve such architecture as\
follows:\
\'95 The architecture elements and interfaces define the\
links to connect local planets with a remote in deep space.\
\'95 A layered/integrated communication architecture\
should provide end-to-end autonomous data routing.\
\'95 Communication nodes (rovers, satellites, spacecrafts\
etc.) take care of the transmission.\
Another work by NASA and JPL focuses on autonomy to\
reduce the dependency on resource scheduling provided by\
Earth operators and increase fault tolerance [23]. This study\
aims at providing a communication architecture specifically\
for Mars exploration, defined as a \'94near-term architecture\'94.\
The authors also further develop concepts raised in [30] such\
as the Radio Frequencies (X,Ka-band) for Earth to Mars\
communication, the satellites (MarSat, AMO, etc.) required\
to maximize bandwidth and get high data rates, and other\
technologies for Backbone network and proximity networks.\
In this paper, we develop an evolutionary IPN architecture\
that takes into consideration NASA\'92s needs and requirements\
[23], [30]\'96[33], but also the time frame for future missions.\
III. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SPACE MEDIUM\
Towards an IPN Internet, we first focus on the transmission\
of data over the different communication mediums. Due to\
(a) The Electromagnetic spectrum [41].\
(b) Blocked and passed radiations in the Earth atmosphere (atmospheric\
windows) [41]. Only visible light and radio frequencies can propagate\
in the atmosphere without distortion or absorption.\
the diversity of the propagation mediums in an IPN context,\
a signal can experience many impairments: [34]:\
\'95 Attenuation is a function of frequency. For high frequencies, the signal may experience distortion for large distances. It is, therefore, crucial to amplify high frequency\
signals.\
\'95 Free Space Loss (FSL) is the primary factor for signal\
loss which is calculated by the following formula [34]\'96\
[37]:\
Ls = ( \uc0\u955 \
4\uc0\u960 R\
)\
2\
, \uc0\u955  = c/ f (1)\
Where R is the distance of the link, \uc0\u955  the wavelength, c\
the speed of light and f the signal frequency.\
\'95 Noise can be thermal, inter-modulation, crosstalk or impulse noise and mixes with the transmitted signal.\
\'95 Delay. There are four major types of delays [38], [39]:\
Processing delay, storage delay, transmission delay, and\
propagation delay. In the context of space communication, the propagation delay caused by the long distances\
is the main challenge.\
\'95 Atmospheric Absorption. On Earth, the peak attenuation\
occurs in presence of water vapor around 22 GHz, and in\
presence of oxygen around 60GHz. Other planets have a\
different atmosphere composition and therefore different\
absorption to take into account [40].\
Figure 2a represents the different electromagnetic radiations: radio (RF), infrared (IR), visible, ultraviolet, x-ray, and\
gamma ray. Most of the electromagnetic radiations emitted by\
outer space don\'92t reach the surface of the Earth except at a\
very few wavelengths, such as the visible spectrum, also called\
free space optic (FSO), radio frequencies (RF), and some\
ultraviolet wavelengths, as shown in Figure 2b. These bands\
are called atmospheric windows [41]\'96[43]. Although Earth\'92s\
Fig. 3: Satellite communication & architecture. The space\
segment and the earth segment are interconnected to provide\
a complete earth coverage.\
atmosphere blocks other bands such as gamma rays, infrared\
or X-rays, we may utilize them to transmit information in\
space and through the atmosphere of other planets. The lower\
power consumption, lower mass, higher range and higher\
bandwidth of optical communication (FSO) compared to RF\
make optical communication the auspicious technology to\
serve as a communication medium in IPN [44]\'96[46].\
In practice, NASA\'92s Laser Communication Relay Demonstration (LCRD) mission [47] continues the legacy of the\
Lunar Laser Communications Demonstration (LLCD) [48],\
using FSO. This latter mission flew aboard a moon-orbiting\
spacecraft called LADEE, Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer [49], in 2013. Overall, compared to traditional communications systems on spacecraft, LLCD used half\
the mass, 25 percent less power, and transmitted six times as\
much data per second. The LCRD project is currently under\
validation, and its launch is scheduled within a commercial\
satellite for 2019 [50].\
IV. SPACE COMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE\
In an IPN context, satellites constellations serve as an access\
network to the planetary surface network. In our architecture,\
the main purpose of satellites is relaying and amplifying radio\
signals around the curve of the earth. In this section, we\
present the technologies currently deployed that can serve for\
the early deployments of an IPN Internet.\
A. Satellite Orbits and constellations\
The current satellite infrastructure is presented Figure 3.\
This infrastructure can be broken down into two segments [51]: the space segment and the ground (or Earth)\
Fig. 4: Hubble Observations\'92 Data Path\
segment. The Space Segment includes the orbiting satellites,\
and the ground stations that provide the operational control\
of the satellite(s) in orbit. The Ground Segment consists of\
the earth surface terminals that employs the communications\
capabilities of the Space Segment. A full constellation of satellites is required to cover the surface of the earth. Nowadays,\
satellites are distributed over three orbits [52], [53]:\
\'95 Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) are synchronized\
with the earth rotation and have a 24-hour view of a\
particular area.\
\'95 Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) orbit the Earth between\
8,000 and 18,000km. As such, they are only visible for\
a period of 2-8 hours for a specific area.\
\'95 Low Earth Orbit(LEO) orbit closer to the earth and are\
only visible for a short period of time (15-20 minutes\
each pass) in a given area.\
The combination of these satellites covers the whole surface\
of Earth thanks to Inter-Satellite Links (ISL). These links can\
either connect two satellites on the same orbits or on different\
orbits [54]. This infrastructure is very convenient for an IPN\
Internet and can be used as an access network between the\
Earth and other planets. In the case of colonies on other\
planets, such constellations could also be deployed to provide\
full surface coverage and interconnect both planets Internets.\
B. Space Communication and Navigations Networks\
The current space communication architecture operated by\
NASA embraces three operational networks that collectively\
provide communications services to supported missions using\
both space and ground-based assets [55]: The Deep Space\
Network (DSN) is composed of three equidistant ground\
stations to provide continuous coverage of GEO orbits, and\
unmanned spacecraft orbiting other planets of our solar system [56], [57]. The Near Earth Network (NEN) consists of\
both NASA and commercial ground stations. It also integrates\
systems providing space communications and tracking services\
to orbital and suborbital missions. Finally, the Space Network\
(SN) is a constellation of geosynchronous relays, Tracking and\
Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS), and associated ground\
stations. For instance, the TDRSS transmits the observations\
of the TDRSS as shown Figure 4. These three networks are\
currently deployed in parallel with minimal interaction. The\
first step towards an extended IPN would be to chain relays\
located near-Earth, in the solar system, and in deep space\
altogether.\
C. Towards Interplanetary Communication\
Most of the nodes involved in an IPN are revolving around\
other stellar objects: planets revolve around the Sun with\
long distances, satellites orbit planets at a relatively close\
range. This motion poses many challenges for interplanetary\
communication [58]\'96[60]:\
\'95 Extremely long and variable propagation delays: 3 to\
20 minutes from Mars to Earth, 4 to 7 hours from Pluto to\
Earth, depending on the relative positions of the planets.\
\'95 Intermittent link connectivity: the Sun or other planets\
may temporarily obscure a given link between two stellar\
objects. For instance, the Earth to Mars line of sight\
is regularly obstructed by the Sun when they reach the\
opposite position in their orbits.\
\'95 Low and asymmetric bandwidth: the limited payload\
available on satellites severely impacts their transmission\
power compared to Earth transmission relays.\
\'95 Absence of fixed infrastructure: the IPN is a purely\
opportunistic network, as the relative position of two\
nodes is in constant movement with great variations in\
the link characteristics except for Geocentric satellites.\
An IPN must address these constraints to optimize the\
few resources available in the system. On the other hand,\
contrary to many other opportunistic networks, the movement\
of potential nodes in the solar system follows regular patterns\
that can be predicted to some extent. Moreover, the number\
of stellar objects enables us to find a path between two nodes\
even in the case of obstruction, using other nodes as relays.\
D. Delay Tolerant Networks (DTN)\
The IPN Internet is an opportunistic network in which endto-end latencies can reach up to a day, and jitter is measured\
in hours. As such, conventional Internet architectures based\
on the TCP/IP stack are not applicable. On the other hand,\
delay-tolerant architectures and protocols were designed to\
withstand the extreme constrains of the system. The first\
concepts of Delay Tolerant Networks (DTN) [61]\'96[63] were\
originally proposed to cope with the characteristics of deep\
space communication (long delays, discontinuous network\
connectivity) before being extended to other domains. The\
nodes of a DTN infrastructure are called DTN gateways and\
provide store-and-forward capabilities to handle the eventual\
link unavailabilities. To cope with the long and variable latencies, DTN architectures insert an overlay network protocol\
called Bundling Protocol (BP), that provides end-to-end\
transmission between heterogeneous links. This overlay takes\
place on top of the transport protocol, ensuring compatibility with existing Internet infrastructures. At each point of\
the network, BP employs the transport protocol adapted to\
the transmission conditions. BP can therefore operate over\
TCP [64], [65] and UDP [66], but also the Licklider Transport\
Protocol (LTP) [67]\'96[69], a point-to-point transmission protocol for intermittent links with long propagation delays. Such\
characteristics make it particularly suitable for interplanetary\
transmission, where the traditional TCP/IP paradigm cannot\
be applied. There are many DTN implementations for the\
Bundling Protocol (BP) that provides the store-and-forward\
capabilities required in deep space environment. In particular,\
Interplanetary Overlay Network (ION), and IRB-DTN were\
designed for deep space communication.\
V. ARCHITECTURE & COMMUNICATION\
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR FUTURE IPN\
The ever-increasing interest to explore the universe motivated us to provide an evolutionary architecture that tackles\
the IPN challenges and bridge large distances in space. After\
a short summary of the main challenges, we detail our vision\
for a long-term reliable and scalable IPN architecture.\
A. IPN Challenges\
Deep space networking presents critical challenges [58]\'96[60]:\
\'95 Distance between planets: extremely long propagation\
delays and high path attenuation between nodes.\
\'95 Planetary motion: not only are propagation delays high\
but due to planetary motion, they are extremely variable.\
Planetary motion also leads to intermittent link connectivity due to conjunction or obstruction [70].\
\'95 Low embeddable payload: satellites can only carry a\
limited payload, which forces us to focus on power, mass,\
size, and cost for communication hardware and protocol\
design. Asymmetric bandwidth on the order of 1000:1 is\
a direct consequence of this limited payload.\
\'95 Relative inaccessibility: the distance between planets\
leads to long travel distances. In order to safely launch a\
mission to a given planet, space travel can only take place\
on specific days, corresponding to favorable conjunctions.\
As such, an IPN architecture should focus on backward\
compatibility and scalability in order to reduce the time\
and cost of deployment.\
With these challenges in mind, we propose an evolutive\
architecture specifically designed to withstand the harsh constraints of deep space communication.\
B. IPN Infrastructure\
Due to the high complexity of deployment, we define 3\
types of intercompatible architectures, each corresponding to\
different milestones in space exploration. We refer to them\
as near-term (current missions), mid-term (human colony on\
Mars) and long-term architectures (manned and unmanned\
colonization of the complete solar system).\
1) IPN Near-Term Communication Architecture:\
We propose an IPN near-term communication architecture\
for the current missions targeting Mars and the Moon. Indeed,\
both are accessible within a reasonable amount of time (3\
days to the moon and 6 to 9 months to Mars) and several\
organizations are already planning manned missions within the\
next 10 years. This architecture reuses a maximum amount of\
Fig. 5: IPN near-term Communication Infrastructure. This\
architecture reuses the existing infrastructure with minimal\
addition.\
available technologies to interconnect the Earth, Mars and the\
Moon in a short time frame.\
Figure 5 illustrates the IPN near-term architecture. We\
separate this architecture in two sub-systems: the physical\
layer, that we will call Spectrum, and the upper layers,\
referred to as Network. The spectrum sub-system provides\
two bands in the microwave carry for data: Ka (26.5-40GHz)\
and X (8-12.4GHz). These bands provide higher data rates\
than the conventional RF bands. The Ka-band allows for the\
communication in the backbone network and for inter-satellite\
communication due to its higher frequency (thus, higher data\
rates). X and Ka together allow for the communication from\
satellites to the surface of the planet. In our architecture, we\
switch between both bands depending on the weather as the\
Ka-band suffers from attenuation in presence of humidity.\
The network sub-system contains three sub-networks (see\
Figure 5): The proximity network contains the inter-element\
links relatively close to the planet or the Moon and the surface\
networks. The access network consists of satellites orbiting\
the planet or the Moon interconnected with each other. In this\
architecture, there are three access networks formed by the\
satellites orbiting each planet and the Moon. The backbone\
network interconnects the three access networks with the\
DSN stations on Earth. This network provides two kinds\
of links for interconnection: direct links and indirect links.\
Direct link connects Mars and lunar relay satellites directly\
to the DSN on Earth. Indirect links go from Mars and lunar\
relay satellites to Earth relay satellites where the data is then\
directed to DSN antennas. We propose to launch four Lunar\
Relay Satellites (LRS) and Mars Relay Orbiter (MRO). Three\
relay satellites are operating, while the fourth remains as a\
spare. We also reuse existing infrastructure. For instance, the\
Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter satellites are planned to function\
until 2030 and could be employed in near term. On Earth,\
Fig. 6: End-to-End Data Transfer Using DTN. In the near-term\
architecture, the DSN directly connects to the Mars Orbiter,\
which relays the bundle to the rover using BP over LTP.\
the satellites that serve as data relay are the Tracking and\
Data Relay Satellites (TDRS). Ten of them are currently\
operating in geostationary orbit. From the equipment on a\
foreign planet to the Earth, each node along the path contains\
DTN technology to support store-and-forward mechanism.\
This technology is installed on DSN, relay satellites (LRS,\
MRO, TDRS), and even in the proximity networks: Landers,\
Robots, Rovers (data collectors), SN and mission centers (data\
destination).\
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) [71], [72] is\
a large, cold and infrared-optimized space observatory that\
will be launched into orbit in 2019. This telescope is a good\
example of a mission that could utilize such architecture.\
Fig 6 outlines the data transmission process from the\
mission center on the Earth to a Mars rover. The BP is\
deployed as an overlay on top of TCP between the mission\
center and the DSN antennas, as TCP is the transport protocol\
in the terrestrial Internet. In the second trunk of the path, BP\
operates on top of LTP between the DSN antennas, the Mars\
Orbiter and the Mars Rover. On this trunk, we transmit data\
using the microwave band Ka and use LTP due to the long\
distance \'96 high latency \'96 between the Earth and Mars. The\
green continuous line depicts the data path from the mission\
center to the Rover. The purple dashed lines show the hop to\
hop acknowledgments between two neighboring elements.\
Currently, the Mars and Moon Orbiters use the Proximity1 data link protocol [73] to communicate with the surface\
elements and the Advanced Orbiting Systems (AOS) space\
data link protocol [74] for communication between orbiters\
and the DSN antennas on Earth.\
2) IPN Mid-Term Communication Architecture:\
For our mid-term architecture, we consider the human\
colonization of Mars and the further side of the moon, which\
will extend to colonizing the whole solar system long term. As\
such, we expect an ever-increasing demand to exchange huge\
amounts of data in both directions. This phenomenon will be\
amplified in case of long-term colonies on foreign planets.\
In this scenario, interplanetary links not only provide Internet\
access outside of the Earth, but also interconnect the planet\
Internets in the same way transatlantic cables interconnect\
Fig. 7: IPN mid-term Communication Infrastructure. We start\
to deploy Lasercom for long distance links, and extend the\
architecture to other planets.\
continents on Earth. Future architectures should, therefore,\
be scalable and tackle the usual bandwidth asymmetry issues\
to address these challenges. In our mid-term architecture,\
we propose using an onboard optical module for spacecrafts\
and optical communication terminals (OCT) on the planet\'92s\
surface to support two-way communication with high data\
rates. This design allows us to considerably reduce the bandwidth asymmetry. These technologies require less power and\
considerably reduce the payload. They are also able to reach\
longer distances and provide higher data rate, 10X - 100X\
higher than RF.\
Figure 7 illustrates the IPN mid-term architecture that\
interconnects the Earth with Mars and other planets. In this\
architecture, we upgrade the transmission spectrum from microwave (X, Ka) to laser Communication, also referred to\
as Free Space Optic (FSO). Optical communication is an\
emerging technology in which data is modulated onto a laser\
for transmission. The laser beam is significantly narrower than\
an RF beam and thus promises to deliver more power and\
achieve higher data rates. In outer space, the communication\
range of FSO communication is in the order of thousands\
of kilometers. Optical telescopes therefore play a pivotal\
role as beam expanders to bridge interplanetary distances of\
millions of kilometers. Our near-term architecture includes\
specific hardware to ensure the provision of optical communication. It includes constellations of geostationary orbiters or\
satellites (Optical TDRS around Earth, Geostationary Mars\
Orbiters(GMOs), Geostationary Planet Orbiter (GPOs)) to\
provide relay service between nodes on the surface of the outer\
planet, in-between planets and between the access network\
from other planets. On each satellite, we embed a small (a\

service interruption.\
dozen cm) Cassegrain reflector to support optical communication. The Optical Deep Space Network (ODSN) substitutes\
the DSN ground stations by supporting two communication\
technologies: RF microwaves (X and Ka-band) and optical\
(Lasercom). This hybrid result in installing optical mirrors\
in the inner 8m of a standard DSN 34m beam waveguide\
antenna. The RF communication is kept in order to maintain\
the operation in all weather conditions. The architecture also\
operates new Laser Communication Terminals (LCT) to exchange data with the GMO, GPO and OTDRS satellites. The\
LCT contains six small (a dozen cm) refractive telescopes for\
the transmitter and a single bigger reflective telescope as a\
receiver. This latter telescope is connected via optical fibers\
to the respective transmitters and receivers.\
3) IPN Long-Term Communication Architecture:\
Optical communication in space is based on line of sight\
(LOS), which may experience obstruction or conjunction. For\
instance, Earth and Mars can be obscured from each other by\
the Sun . This obstruction lasts for two weeks every 26 months.\
Moreover, LOS communication in space attenuates because of\
Free-Space Loss (FSL) which increases with distances, as we\
showed in Equation 1. Therefore, communication between the\
Earth and further planets experiences much more attenuation\
than communication between the Earth and Mars. If we\
consider transmission between the Earth and Pluto, the signal\
travels 38.44 AU = 5,766,million km (0.52 AU for Earth to\
Mars) in space and needs 5.4 hours to reach its destination.\
We propose operating spacecrafts in Sun-Earth\'92s Lagrangian\
points to address these problems. Fig 8 shows the positions\
of the five Lagrangian Points L1,L2,L3,L4,L5. At each point,\
the gravitational forces of two large bodies (Sun-Earth for instance) cancel the centrifugal force. A spacecraft can therefore\
occupy the point and move around the Sun without the need\
for external intervention. These points are commonly used for\
observation missions and are envisioned as relays for space\
colonization [75]. In our architecture, we employ these points\
to operate spacecrafts as repeater and relay nodes in deep\
space. These nodes bridge the distances between the planets,\
where they relay data using lasercom to the destination. They\
also allow to multiply the number of orbiting points in the solar\
Fig. 9: IPN long-term Communication Infrastructure. Lasercom is now generalized to all communication. We increase\
redundancy with the introduction of more spacecrafts in Lagrangian points as data relays.\
system to propose alternative paths in case of obstruction or\
conjunction. More specifically, we propose to place spacecrafts\
in points L4 and L5 to address obstruction and conjunction,\
and spacecrafts in L1 and L2 to tackle attenuation.\
In the case of a planet-to-Earth transmission, data first goes\
through a Front End Relay Spacecraft (FERS) in the source\'92s\
planet Lagrangian point L1. On the relay planet, data then\
passes through a Front End Relay Spacecraft (FERS) in L1\
and a Back End Relay Spacecraft (BERS) in L2. Finally, on\
Earth, we position a FERS in Earth L1 (EL1), a BERS in\
EL2, a Lead Relay Spacecraft (LDRS) in EL4 and a Follow\
Relay Spacecraft (FWRS) in EL5, as shown Figure 8. The\
LDRS and the FWRS maintain the communication with other\
planets even if they are located behind the Sun. They also\
help to fragment the communication distance, especially for\
the communication with planets on the opposite side of the\
Sun.\
C. Autonomous Routing\
Currently, space communication systems are missionspecific and point-to-point. Moreover, they are dependent on\
operator-specific resources. Our approach aims at reducing the\
dependency on resource scheduling provided by Earth operators and interconnect the planets. To do so, our architecture\
provides autonomous operation of the spacecrafts, as well as\
autonomous routing of commands and data in space.\
We adopt DTN to provide autonomous data routing mechanisms similar to Terrestrial Internet routing capabilities. This\
approach solves half of the autonomous routing issue by\
providing an overlay over the lower five OSI layers. As such,\
the transmission is independent of the underlying routing\
protocols. However, DTN operates on point-to-point communication, whereas IPN needs multi-point communication,\
which represents the other half of the autonomous routing\
issues. We solve these issues by allowing the routing protocol\
to control the antenna pointing, transmit power and data\
rates, and provide synchronization capabilities between the\
sender or the receiver. This solution requires interactive links\
between the nodes that can be created and broken on demand\
at any time in the whole IPN Network. These on-demand\
features require specific hardware for pointing and focusing\
transmission. We propose using 2-axis gimbals (azimuth and\
elevation) [76], [77], Coarse Pointing Assembly (CPA) and\
Fine Pointing Assembly (FPA) [76]\'96[80] to orient the antenna\
and the beam. Beside DTN, we combine the two following\
mechanisms to provide autonomous data routing and mimic\
the communication used in mobile networks:\
\'95 Locating and Calculation Subsystem. Each Optical\
Communication Terminal (OCT) computes onboard the\
orbital position of its partner (receiver OCT) and finds\
its angular velocity. This is the initial telescope pointing\
phase. This approach uses the reference position and\
the new position as input parameters for the position\
controller, and the reference velocity and the current\
velocity to feed in the velocity controller. This ensures\
inertial LOS orientation towards the partner for stabilization purposes. The OCT also calculates the distance to the\
partner and adjusts the transmission power accordingly.\
\'95 Pointing Control Subsystem. This technique employs\
the same laser for transmitting and as a beacon. The\
beam-width is controlled from broad in the acquisition\
stage (also referred to as Coarse Pointing), to narrow in\
the tracking stage (also referred to as Fine Pointing). The\
acquisition is achieved by the hardware 2-axis gimbals\'92\
pointing and a Coarse Pointing Assembly (CPA) which\
allow contact with broad beacon beam. When acquired,\
the beam focusing phase (Fine Pointing) progressively\
narrows the beam while correcting the pointing accuracy\
up to sufficient level of beam concentration to get maximum received power, thus high data-rates. This stage uses\
either the Fine Pointing Assembly (FPA) or beam control\
approach which includes three control components: Fast\
Steering Mirror (FSM), Point Ahead Mirror, and Laser\
Beam Defocus Mechanism (LBD).\
We combine both mechanisms to quickly find a new partner\
and reduce the off-line time.\
D. Technologies integration\
We now draw the attention to the technologies that make\
this architecture possible. We specifically focus on the communication and hardware aspects of a durable infrastructure.\
1) SmartSSR DTN Router:\
To interconnect the local Internet, with other planets\'92 Internet,\
a DTN Router (also referred to as DTN Gateway) is necessary.\
This router is provided with one of DTN implementation that\
contains the bundling protocol, convergence layer protocol and\
Fig. 10: The SmartSSR Prototype Development Board Architecture.\
transport protocols, LTP, TCP, and UDP. DTN Routers should\
meet the payload constraints of the satellites and spacecraft.\
The SmartSSR is a solid-state recorder (SSR) developed by\
the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) that enables spacecrafts\
to operate as DTN routers. Its small mass and size combined\
with its relative low cost make it easy to massively install on\
the payload module of any spacecraft. These features make the\
SmartSSR an optimal choice to provide DTN capabilities. The\
SmartSSR\'92s main goal is to tackle intermittent connectivity.\
It features JPL\'92s DTN ION implementation to store large\
amounts of data when the link to the next hop is not available.\
It also features LTP as a transport protocol for delivering data.\
The SmartSSR combines a NAND flash array with a general\
purpose processor to host several closely related functions (see\
Figure 10). This processor is based on LEON3FT processor\
and uses SpaceWire interfaces to communicate with other\
spacecrafts components. The SmartSSR uses the Space File\
System (SpaceFFS) to manage spacecraft data. This FS is\
adapted of a flash file system to meet the special requirements\
of space operational environment [81]\'96[83].\
2) Optical Communication:\
The key technologies for providing optical communication\
are the flight terminals, ground laser transmitters and ground\
laser receivers. Both the flight terminal and ground receivers\
use telescopes to operate as beam expanders to bridge interplanetary distances of millions of kilometers. The flight\
laser terminal (FLT) carries a 22cm aperture, 4 W laser and\
contains an isolation and pointing assembly (IPA) for operating\
in the presence of spacecraft vibrational disturbance, and a\
photon-counting camera to enable the acquisition, tracking\
and signal reception. The ground terminals contain photoncounting ground detectors that can be integrated with large\
aperture ground collecting apertures (telescopes) for detecting\
the faint downlink signal from deep space. In our architecture,\
we propose to place optical communication terminals (OCT),\
also referred to as Laser Communication Terminal (LCT), like\
those used in OCTL.We also consider embedding Cassegrain\
telescopes beside FLT as a part of the payload of the orbiter\
satellites and relay spacecrafts in Lagrangian Points to operate\
as transceivers and provide the autonomous operations.\
(a) Jupiter Rover to Mars BERS. Data flows through Jupiter\'92s\
Geostationary orbiter, which transmits to Jupiter\'92s FERS.\
Jupiter\'92s FERS then transmit the data to Mars BERS.\
(b) Mars FERS to Earth Mission Center. Mars FERS transmits\
the bundles either to Mars FERS or to Earth LDRS, depending\
on conjunction. Earth LDRS then transmits the bundles to the\
mission center.\
Fig. 11: End-to-End data path for long-term Architecture.\
E. Integration Scenario\
Let\'92s consider an exploration scenario on Jupiter, with\
several rovers, sensors, and robots working together. These\
modules generate a meta-data file containing sensed data\
directed to Earth. In this section, we describe the full operation\
of the system, from the communication medium to the selected\
path and the involved nodes. In this scenario, we use Mars as\
a relay between Jupiter and Earth to re-amplify the signal and\
counteract eventual occlusion.\
We use SmartSSR in each node to provide DTN capabilities. Each node stores and carries data until a\
link to the destination is available. DTN uses tiered\
naming, addressing and routing. It uses region ID as\
global unique identifier and entity ID for late binding as follows: Bundle://regionID:entitiyID. A\
Jupiter rover sending a file to Nasa will name the bundle Bundle://Earth.int.tcp://www.nasa.gov,\
with Bundle the transmission unit, Earth.int.tcp the\
destination regionID, and www.nasa.gov the destination\
entityID. This naming convention allows the bundle to be first\
directed to the Earth. Once the bundle reaches the Earth, it is\
then directed to NASA using the Earth Internet.\
We represent the operation of our system in Figure 11. The\
Jupiter rover sends the file using the international communication protocol CCSDS File Delivery Protocol (CFDP). CFDP\
provides reliable delivery of data and has been specifically\
designed for use across space links [84], [85]. In the region\
Jupiter.int.ltp, the Bundling Protocol (BP) encapsulates the file into bundles. These bundles are stored on the\
rover and forwarded when the link with Geostationary Jupiter\
Orbiter (GJO) becomes available. Once the link to the GJO\
is available, BP invokes LTP to transport each bundle as\
segments. The segments are then sent to the GJO using either\
laser communication or Ultra High Frequency RF (UHF). The\
GJO then follows the same logic to transmit the bundles to\
Jupiter\'92s FERS, using laser communication. Jupiter\'92s FERS\
will try to communicate with element with it has in its line\
of sight. If the link to Mars BERS is not available, Jupiter\'92s\
FERS stores the bundles on persistent storage (Flash NAND\
in SmartSSR) and carries the bundles until the link to the next\
hop becomes available.\
Let\'92s assume that Mars is the closest planet between Jupiter\
and the Earth. Jupiter\'92s FERS will communicate with Mars\
BERS using the same protocols and medium. The next region\
is then mars.int.ltp to which Jupiter\'92s FERS can forward\
the bundles that it has in its persistent storage. As soon as\
Jupiter\'92s FERS receives acknowledgment from Mars BERS,\
it remove the bundles from the persistent storage. The Mars\
BERS relays the bundles through Mars FERS, or directly to\
Earth\'92s LDRS, in the region Earth.int.tcp, based on onboard autonomous routing.\
The Earth\'92s LDRS communicates with the nearest Optical TDRS (OTDRS) orbiting the Earth to pass the bundles\
using the same protocols and communication medium. The\
OTDRS then communicates with the OCT. To send each\
bundle, BP invokes the underlying convergence layer agent\
to transform from LTP to TCP to transport the bundles. The\
OCT directs the optics to the control room where the laser is\
demodulated digital data. This data is finally transferred using\
unshielded twisted pairs cables (UTP) to the mission center,\
with destination www.nasa.gov. After delivering data to\
mission control center, the de-encapsulation process converts\
the TCP segments into bundles and deliver them into the\
CFDP to build the file. The BP in the mission center\'92s DTN\
node creates an acknowledgment to confirm data reception.\
This acknowledgment follows the backward path to confirm\
the delivery of data on hop-to-hop basis (dotted lines on\
Figure 11). In this system, the transmission protocols (LTP\
and TCP) ensure DTN node-to-node reliability. BP provides\
end-to-end reliability.\
F. IPN Implementation Notes\
The technologies we discussed in this paper still require\
lots of research and development before being enabled in\
a large scale project such as the IPN. To provide 2-way\
laser communication and tackle bandwidth asymmetry, current\
technologies are in drastic need of miniaturization, not only\
for the sake of better functionalities but also for lowering\
the cost of deployment. One of the challenges to improve\
bidirectional link establishment time resides in improving the\
(a) Mission-independent SDN hierarchy over the whole IPN.\
(b) Mission-dependent SDN hierarchy align with SDR over\
specific element in IPN architecture.\
Fig. 12: Integrating SDN on IPN\
pointing methods. When a node points to another node, the\
receiving node should be able to infer the emplacement of the\
transmitting node from the light signal itself and respond by an\
uplink laser beacon to guide the transmitter, then redirect the\
laser beam to the exact location of the the receiving telescope.\
In the IPN, deploying a new node takes several years, and\
systems work autonomously for decades. The possibilities\
for hardware failure should thus be minimized. On Earth\'92s\
computer networks, the current trend is to replace hardware\
elements with software. This new approach allows reducing\
deployment costs, while enabling us to update the internal\
mechanisms without physical access to the hardware. Two\
technologies are especially promising for the IPN. First,\
Software Defined Radio (SDR) delegates all the modulation\
operations to software modules, and use generic radio antennas\
for transmission. This architecture helps to achieve the desired\
miniaturization while limiting the number of points of failure\
on the hardware. As shown Figure 12, Software Defined\
Networks (SDN) separates the control plane from the data\
plane and allows to dynamically redefine the logical architecture of the network, allowing greater long-term flexibility.\
In Figure 12, we demonstrate how to use SDN to control the\
equipments for a given mission. We apply SDN on the element\
level to reflect the requirements of the mission, for example\
control the transmit power, the beam width, and the RF band\
used depending of SDR.\
The Interplanetary Transport Network (ITN) is a collection\
of gravitationally determined pathways through the Solar System that requires negligible energy for the spacecraft to follow.\
One instance of these pathways are the Sun-planet Lagrangian\
points. These points give the opportunity to perform formation\
flying [86] or deploy constellations of spacecrafts to transmit\
data back and forth depending on their motion through the\
solar system with minimal maintenance.\
Caching data is also an important issue to study. Placing\
previously requested information in temporary storage, or\
cache reduces demand on bandwidth and accelerates access\
to the most active data. In the case of human colonies on\
other planets, this functionality is vital for sharing the human\
knowledge pool between all planets. The technology to use for\
such functionality needs to be carefully discussed, as storage\
lifespan (which is already limited on Earth) may be severely\
reduced by the electromagnetic radiations present in deep\
space. Finally, a caching architecture designed for decades\
raises the question of the amount of storage to integrate for\
the system not to become obsolete.\
VI. CONCLUSION\
Space agencies and private organization have developed the\
technologies to conduct many missions for the purpose of exploring the universe, find alternative resources and broaden the\
science. Currently, the communication architectures supporting\
these missions are point-to-point and mission dependent.\
This paper proposes an evolutionary architecture towards\
an Interplanetary Internet (IPN) to migrate from missioncentric architectures to a single common, scalable and reliable\
architecture. Through this paper, we propose an evolutionary\
architecture based on the time-frame of future missions. The\
Near-Term architecture uses the available technologies and\
employ them to create an architecture that interconnect the\
current and near-future regions of interest (Mars and Moon).\
This architecture uses DTN and the suitable protocols to overcome the challenges enforced by deep space communication.\
The Mid-Term architecture addresses the growing demand\
to exchange huge amount of data between planets, especially\
after colonizing Mars. This architecture\'92s main evolution takes\
place in the spectrum architecture. Transmission transits from\
using RF communication to Laser communication, aligned\
with the foreseen evolution of hardware. Finally, for further\
reaching and continuous communication, we propose a LongTerm architecture. In this architecture, spacecraft are placed\
as relay nodes in space where they serve as repeaters to\
bridge the large distances, and overcome solar conjunction and\
signal attenuation. We integrate DTN into each stage of our\
approach and propose a solution for multipoint communication\
and autonomous routing in space. We finally provided an\
integration scenario for sending a file from Jupiter to the\
Earth passing through Mars using every component of our\
architecture, and discussed implementation concerns regarding\
the feasibility of an IPN with current technologies.\
With this paper, we hope to have provided a novel point of\
view for future IPN architectures, and set some foundations\
for an actual implementation within the next decades.}{\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252\cocoartf2577

\f0\fs24 \cf0 Google's Chief Internet Evangelist on Creating the Interplanetary Internet\
When some future Mars colonist is able to open his browser and watch a cat in a shark suit chasing a duck while riding a roomba, they will have Vint Cerf to thank. Wired talked to the Chief Internet Evangelist at Google to get a sense of how the interplanetary internet works.\
\
WHEN SOME FUTURE Mars colonist is able to open his browser and watch a cat in a shark suit chasing a duck while riding a roomba, they will have Vint Cerf to thank.\
\
In his role as Google's chief internet evangelist, Cerf has spent much of his time thinking about the future of the computer networks that connect us all. And he should know. Along with Bob Kahn, he was responsible for developing the internet protocol suite, commonly known as TCP/IP, that underlies the workings of the net. Not content with just being a founding father of the internet on this planet, Cerf has spent years taking the world wide web out of this world.\
\
Working with NASA and JPL, Cerf has helped develop a new set of protocols that can stand up to the unique environment of space, where orbital mechanics and the speed of light make traditional networking extremely difficult. Though this space-based network is still in its early stages and has few nodes, he said that we are now at "the front end of what could be an evolving and expanding interplanetary backbone."\
\
Father of the Internet Vint Cerf is responsible for helping develop the TCP/IP protocols that underly the web. In his role as Google's chief internet evangelist, Cerf is dedicated to thinking about the future of the net, including its use in space. Image: Google/Weinberg-ClarkWired talked to Cerf about the interplanetary internet's role in space exploration, the frustrations of network management on the final frontier, and the future headline he never wants to see.\
\
__Wired: __Though it\'92s been around a while, the concept of an interplanetary internet is probably new to a lot of people. How exactly do you build a space network?\
\
__Vint Cerf: __Right, it\'92s actually not new at all \'96 this project started in 1998. And it got started because 1997 was very nearly the 25th anniversary of the design of the internet. Bob Kahn and I did that work in 1973. So back in 1997, I asked myself what should I be doing that will be needed 25 years from then. And, after consultation with colleagues at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, we concluded that we needed much richer networking than was then available to NASA and other space faring agencies.\
\
Up until that time and generally speaking, up until now, the entire communications capabilities for space exploration had been point-to-point radio links. So we began looking at the possibilities of TCIP/IP as a protocol for interplanetary communication. We figure it worked on Earth and it ought to work on Mars. The real question was, \'93Would it work between the planets?\'94 And the answer turned out to be, \'93No.\'94\
\
The reason for this is two-fold: First of all, the speed of light is slow relative to distances in the solar system. A one-way radio signal from Earth to Mars takes between three and half and 20 minutes. So round trip time is of course double that. And then there\'92s the other problem: planetary rotation. If you\'92re communicating with something on the surface of the planet, it goes out of communication as the planet rotates. It breaks the available communications and you have to wait until the planet rotates back around again. So what we have is variable delay and disruption, and TCP does not do terribly well in those kinds of situations.\
\
One of the things that the TCP/IP protocols assume is that there isn\'92t enough memory in each of the routers to hold anything. So if a packet shows up and it\'92s destined for a place for which you have an available path, but there isn\'92t enough room, then typically the packet is discarded.\

We developed a new suite of protocols that we called the Bundle protocols, which are kind of like internet packets in the sense that they\'92re chunks of information. They can be quite big and they basically get sent like bundles of information. We do what\'92s called store and forward, which is the way all packet switching works. It\'92s just in this case the interplanetary protocol has the capacity to store quite a bit, and usually for quite a long time before we can get rid of it based on connectivity to the next hop.\
\
__Wired: __What are the challenges with working and making a communications network in space as opposed to a ground-based internet?\
\
__Cerf: __Among the hard things, first of all, is that we couldn\'92t use the domain name system in its current form. I can give you a quick illustration why that\'92s the case: Imagine for a moment you\'92re on Mars, and somebody is trying to open up an HTTP web connection to Earth. They\'92ve given you a URL that contains a domain name in it, but before you can open up a TCP connection you need to have an IP address.\
\
So you will have to do a domain name lookup, which can translate the domain name you\'92re trying to lookup into an IP address. Now remember you\'92re on Mars and the domain name you\'92re trying to look up is on Earth. So you send out a DNS lookup. But it may take anywhere from 40 minutes to an unknown amount of time -- depending on what kind of packet loss you have, whether there\'92s a period of disruption based on planetary rotation, all that kind of stuff -- before you get an answer back. And then it may be the wrong answer, because by the time it gets back maybe the node has moved and now it has a different IP address. And from there it just gets worse and worse. If you\'92re sitting around Jupiter, and trying to do a lookup, many hours go by and then it\'92s just impossible.\
\
So we had to break it into a two-phase lookup and use what\'92s called delayed binding. First you figure out which planet you\'92re going to, then you route the traffic to that planet, and only then you do a local lookup, possibly using the domain name.\
\
The other thing is when you are trying to manage a network with this physical scope and all the uncertainty delays, the things we typically do for network management don\'92t work very well. There\'92s a protocol called SNMP, the simple network management protocol, and it is based on the idea that you can send a packet out and get an answer back in a few milliseconds, or a few hundreds of milliseconds. If you\'92re familiar with the word ping, you\'92ll know what I mean, because you ping something and expect to get an answer back fairly quickly. If you don\'92t get it back in a minute or two, you begin to conclude that there is something wrong and the thing isn\'92t available. But in space, it takes a long time for the signal to even get to the destination let alone get an answer back. So network management turns out to be a lot harder in this environment.\
\
Then the other thing we had to worry about was security. The reason for that should be obvious -- one of the things we wanted to avoid was the possibility of a headline that says: \'9315-Year-Old Takes Over Mars Net.\'94 Against that possibility we put quite a bit of security into the system, including strong authentication, three way handshakes, cryptographic keys, and things of that sort in order to reduce the likelihood that someone would abuse access to the space network.\

An Aerospace Whiz Shows Off a Space Suit Made for Mars\
\
__Cerf: __Well, in purely physical terms -- that is, in terms of distance -- it\'92s a pretty large network. But the number of nodes is pretty modest. At the moment, the elements participating in it are devices in planet Earth, including the Deep Space Network, which is operated at JPL. That consists of three 70-meter dishes plus a smattering of 35-meter dishes that can reach out into the solar system with point-to-point radio links. Those are part of the TDRSS [tee-driss] system, which is used for a lot of near-Earth communications by NASA. The ISS also has several nodes on board capable of using this particular set of protocols.\

Two orbiters around Mars are running the prototype versions of this software, and virtually all the information that\'92s coming back from Mars is coming back via these store-forward relays. The Spirit and Opportunity rovers on the planet and the Curiosity rover are using these protocols. And then there\'92s the Phoenix lander, which descended to the north pole of Mars in 2008. It also was using these protocols until the Martian winter shut it down.\
\
And finally, there\'92s a spacecraft in orbit around the sun, which is actually quite far away, called EPOXI [the spacecraft was 32 million kilometers from Earth when it tested the interplanetary protocols]. It has been used to rendezvous with two comets in the last decade to determine their mineral makeup.\
\
But what we hope will happen over time -- assuming these protocols are adopted by the Consultative Committee on Space Data Systems, which standardizes space communication protocols -- then every spacefaring nation launching either robotic or manned missions has the option of using these protocols. And that means that all the spacecraft that have been outfitted with those protocols could be used during the primary mission, and could then be repurposed to become relays in a stored forward network. I fully expect to see these protocols used for both manned and robotic exploration in the future.\
\
____Wired: ____What are the next steps to expand this?\
\
__Cerf: __We want to complete the standardization with the rest of the spacefaring community. Also, not all pieces are fully validated yet, including our strong authentication system. Then second, we need to know how well we can do flow control in this very, very peculiar and potentially disrupted environment.\

Third, we need to verify that we can do serious real-time things including chat, video and voice. We will need to learn how to go from what appears to be an interactive real-time chat, like one over the phone, to probably an email-like exchange, where you might have voice and video attached but it\'92s not immediately interactive.\
\
Delivering the bundle is very much like delivering a piece of email. If there\'92s a problem with email it usually gets retransmitted, and after a while you time out. The bundle protocol has similar characteristics, so you anticipate that you have variable delay that could be very long. Sometimes if you\'92ve tried many times and don\'92t get a response, you have to assume the destination is not available.\
\
__Wired: __We often talk about how the things we invent for space are being used here on Earth. Are there things about the interplanetary internet that could potentially be used on the ground?\
\
__Cerf: __Absolutely. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) funded tests with the U.S. Marine Corps on tactical military communication using these highly resilient and disruption-tolerant protocols. We had successful tests that showed in a typical hostile communication environment that we were able to put three to five times more data through this disrupted system than we could with traditional TCP/IP.\
\
Part of the reason is that we assume we can store traffic in the network. When there\'92s high activity, we don\'92t have to retransmit from end to end, we can just retransmit from one of the intermediate points in the system. This use of memory in the network turns out to be quite effective. And of course we can afford to do that because memory has gotten so inexpensive.\
\
The European Commission has also sponsored a really interesting project using the DTN protocols in northern Sweden. In an area called Lapland, there\'92s a group called the Saami reindeer herders. They\'92ve been herding reindeer for 8,000 years up there. And the European Commission sponsored a research project managed by the Lulea University of Technology in northern Sweden to put these protocols on board all-terrain vehicles in laptops. This way, you could run a Wi-Fi service in villages in Northern Sweden and drop messages off and pick them up according to the protocols. As you move around, you were basically a data mule carrying information from one village to another.\
\
__Wired: __There was also an experiment called Mocup that involved remote controlling a robot on Earth from the space station. These protocols were used, right?\
\
__Cerf: __Yes, we used the DTN protocols for that. We were all really excited for that because, although the protocols were originally designed to deal with very long and uncertain delay, when there is high quality connectivity, we can use it for real-time communication. And that\'92s exactly what they did with the little German rover.\
\
I think in general communication will benefit from this. Putting these protocols in mobile phones, for instance, would create a more powerful and resilient communications platform than what we typically have today\
\
__Wired: __So if I have poor reception on my cell phone at my house, I could still call my parents?\
\
__Cerf: __Well, actually what might happen is that you could store what you said and they would eventually get it. But it wouldn\'92t be real time. If the disruption lasts for an appreciable length of time, it would arrive later. But at least the information would eventually get there.}{\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252\cocoartf2577

\f0\fs24 \cf0 Wow! signal\
\
\
The Wow! signal represented as "6EQUJ5". The original printout with Ehman's handwritten exclamation is preserved by Ohio History Connection.[1]\
The Wow! signal was a strong narrowband radio signal received on August 15, 1977, by Ohio State University's Big Ear radio telescope in the United States, then used to support the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. The signal appeared to come from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius and bore the expected hallmarks of extraterrestrial origin.\
\
Astronomer Jerry R. Ehman discovered the anomaly a few days later while reviewing the recorded data. He was so impressed by the result that he circled the reading on the computer printout, "6EQUJ5", and wrote the comment "Wow!" on its side, leading to the event's widely used name.[2]\
\
The entire signal sequence lasted for the full 72-second window during which Big Ear was able to observe it, but has not been detected since, despite several subsequent attempts by Ehman and others. Many hypotheses have been advanced on the origin of the emission, including natural and human-made sources, but none of them adequately explain the signal.[3]\
\
Although the Wow! signal had no detectable modulation\'97a technique used to transmit information over radio waves\'97it remains the strongest candidate for an alien radio transmission ever detected.[3]\
\
In a 1959 paper, Cornell University physicists Philip Morrison and Giuseppe Cocconi had speculated that any extraterrestrial civilization attempting to communicate via radio signals might do so using a frequency of 1420 megahertz (21 centimeters), which is naturally emitted by hydrogen, the most common element in the universe and therefore likely familiar to all technologically advanced civilizations.[4]\
\
In 1973, after completing an extensive survey of extragalactic radio sources, Ohio State University assigned the now-defunct Ohio State University Radio Observatory (nicknamed "Big Ear") to the scientific search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), in the longest-running program of its kind in history.[clarification needed] The radio telescope was located near the Perkins Observatory on the campus of Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio.[citation needed]\
\
By 1977, Ehman was working at the SETI project as a volunteer; his job involved analyzing by hand large amounts of data processed by an IBM 1130 computer and recorded on line printer paper. While perusing data collected on August 15 at 22:16 EDT (02:16 UTC), he spotted a series of values of signal intensity and frequency that left him and his colleagues astonished.[4] The event was later documented in technical detail by the observatory's director.[5]\
\
Signal measurement\
\
Plot of signal intensity versus time fitted with a Gaussian function.\
The string 6EQUJ5, commonly misinterpreted as a message encoded in the radio signal, represents in fact the signal's intensity variation over time, expressed in the particular measuring system adopted for the experiment. The signal itself appeared to be an unmodulated continuous wave, although any modulation with a period of less than 10 seconds or longer than 72 seconds would not have been detectable.[6][7]\
\
Intensity\
The signal intensity was measured as signal-to-noise ratio, with the noise (or baseline) averaged over the previous few minutes. The signal was sampled for 10 seconds and then processed by the computer, which took 2 seconds. Therefore, every 12 seconds the result for each frequency channel was output on the printout as a single character, representing the 10-second average intensity, minus the baseline, expressed as a dimensionless multiple of the signal's standard deviation.[8]\
\
In the chosen alphanumeric measuring system, a space character denotes an intensity between 0 and 1, that is between baseline and one standard deviation above it. The numbers 1 to 9 denote the correspondingly numbered intensities (from 1 to 9); intensities of 10 and above are indicated by a letter: "A" corresponds to intensities between 10 and 11, "B" to 11 to 12, and so on. The Wow! signal's highest measured value was "U" (an intensity between 30 and 31), that is thirty standard deviations above background noise.[2][8]\
\
Frequency\
John Kraus, the director of the observatory, gave a value of 1420.3556 MHz in a 1994 summary written for Carl Sagan.[5] However, Ehman in 1998 gave a value of 1420.4556\'b10.005 MHz.[9] This is (50\'b15 kHz) above the hydrogen line value (with no red- or blue-shift) of 1420.4058 MHz. If due to blue-shift, it would correspond to the source moving about 10 km/s (6.2 mi/s) towards Earth.\
\
\
A heat map of the computer printout, giving a spectrogram of the beam; the Wow! signal appears as a bright spot in the lower left.\
An explanation of the difference between Ehman's value and Kraus's can be found in Ehman's paper. An oscillator, which became the first local oscillator, was ordered for the frequency of 1450.4056 MHz. However, the university's purchasing department made a typographical error in the order and wrote 1450.5056 MHz (i.e., 0.1 MHz higher than desired). The software used in the experiment was then written to adjust for this error. When Ehman computed the frequency of the Wow! signal, he took this error into account.[citation needed]\
\
Bandwidth\
The Wow! signal was a narrowband emission: its bandwidth was less than 10 kHz. The Big Ear telescope was equipped with a receiver capable of measuring fifty 10 kHz-wide channels. The output from each channel was represented in the computer printout as a column of alphanumeric intensity values. The Wow! signal is essentially confined to one column.[9]\
\
Time variation\
At the time of the observation, the Big Ear radio telescope was only adjustable for altitude (or height above the horizon), and relied on the rotation of the Earth to scan across the sky. Given the speed of Earth's rotation and the spatial width of the telescope's observation window, the Big Ear could observe any given point for just 72 seconds.[3] A continuous extraterrestrial signal, therefore, would be expected to register for exactly 72 seconds, and the recorded intensity of such signal would display a gradual increase for the first 36 seconds\'97peaking at the center of the observation window\'97and then a gradual decrease as the telescope moved away from it. All these characteristics are present in the Wow! signal.[10][11]\
\
Celestial location\
\
The two regions of space in the constellation Sagittarius from where the Wow! signal may have originated. The ambiguity is due to how the telescope was designed. For clarity, the widths (right ascension) of the red bands have been exaggerated.\
The precise location in the sky where the signal apparently originated is uncertain due to the design of the Big Ear telescope, which featured two feed horns, each receiving a beam from slightly different directions, while following Earth's rotation. The Wow! signal was detected in one beam but not in the other, and the data was processed in such a way that it is impossible to determine which of the two horns received the signal.[12] There are, therefore, two possible right ascension (RA) values for the location of the signal (expressed below in terms of the two main reference systems):[13]\
\
B1950 equinox	J2000 equinox\
RA (positive horn)	19h22m24.64s \'b1 5s	19h25m31s \'b1 10s\
RA (negative horn)	19h25m17.01s \'b1 5s	19h28m22s \'b1 10s\
In contrast, the declination was unambiguously determined to be as follows:\
\

The galactic coordinates for the positive horn are l=11.7\'b0, b=\uc0\u8722 18.9\'b0, and for the negative horn l=11.9\'b0, b=\u8722 19.5\'b0, both being therefore about 19\'b0 toward the southeast of the galactic plane, and about 24\'b0 or 25\'b0 east of the galactic centre. The region of the sky in question lies northwest of the globular cluster M55, in the constellation Sagittarius, roughly 2.5 degrees south of the fifth-magnitude star group Chi Sagittarii, and about 3.5 degrees south of the plane of the ecliptic. The closest easily visible star is Tau Sagittarii.[14]\
\
No nearby sun-like stars were within the antenna coordinates, although in any direction the antenna pattern would encompass about six distant stars.[6]\
\
Hypotheses on the signal's origin\
A number of hypotheses have been advanced as to the source and nature of the Wow! signal. None of them have achieved widespread acceptance. Interstellar scintillation of a weaker continuous signal\'97similar in effect to atmospheric twinkling\'97could be an explanation, but that would not exclude the possibility of the signal being artificial in origin. The significantly more sensitive Very Large Array did not detect the signal, and the probability that a signal below the detection threshold of the Very Large Array could be detected by the Big Ear due to interstellar scintillation is low.[15] Other hypotheses include a rotating lighthouse-like source, a signal sweeping in frequency, or a one-time burst.[13]\
\
Ehman has said: "We should have seen it again when we looked for it 50 times. Something suggests it was an Earth-sourced signal that simply got reflected off a piece of space debris."[16] He later recanted his skepticism somewhat, after further research showed an Earth-borne signal to be very unlikely, given the requirements of a space-borne reflector being bound to certain unrealistic requirements to sufficiently explain the signal.[9] Also, it is problematic to propose that the 1420 MHz signal originated from Earth since this is within a protected spectrum: a bandwidth reserved for astronomical purposes in which terrestrial transmitters are forbidden to transmit.[17][18] In a 1997 paper, Ehman resists "drawing vast conclusions from half-vast data"\'97acknowledging the possibility that the source may have been military or otherwise a product of Earth-bound humans.[19]\
\
METI president Douglas Vakoch told Die Welt that any putative SETI signal detections must be replicated for confirmation, and the lack of such replication for the Wow! signal means it has little credibility.[20]\
\
In a 2012 podcast, scientific skeptic author Brian Dunning concluded that a radio transmission from deep space in the direction of Sagittarius, as opposed to a near-Earth origin, remains the best technical explanation for the emission, although there is no evidence to conclude that an alien intelligence was the source.[3]\
\
Discredited hypotheses\
In 2017, Antonio Paris, a teacher from Florida, proposed that the hydrogen cloud surrounding two comets, 266P/Christensen and 335P/Gibbs, now known to have been in the same region of the sky, could have been the source of the Wow! signal.[21][22][23] This hypothesis was dismissed by astronomers, including members of the original Big Ear research team, as the cited comets were not in the beam at the correct time. Furthermore, comets do not emit strongly at the frequencies involved, and there is no explanation for why a comet would be observed in one beam but not in the other.[24][25]\
\
Searches for recurrence of the signal\
Several attempts were made by Ehman and other astronomers to recover and identify the signal. The signal was expected to occur three minutes apart in each of the telescope's feed horns, but that did not happen.[11] Ehman unsuccessfully searched for recurrences using Big Ear in the months after the detection.[15]\
\
In 1987 and 1989, Robert H. Gray searched for the event using the META array at Oak Ridge Observatory, but did not detect it.[15][26][page needed] In a July 1995 test of signal detection software to be used in its upcoming Project Argus, SETI League executive director H. Paul Shuch made several drift-scan observations of the Wow! signal's coordinates with a 12-meter radio telescope at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia, also achieving a null result.\
\
In 1995 and 1996, Gray again searched for the signal using the Very Large Array, which is significantly more sensitive than Big Ear.[15][26][page needed] Gray and Simon Ellingsen later searched for recurrences of the event in 1999 using the 26-meter radio telescope at the University of Tasmania's Mount Pleasant Radio Observatory.[27] Six 14-hour observations were made at positions in the vicinity, but nothing like the Wow! signal was detected.[11][26][page needed]\
\
Response\
In 2012, on the 35th anniversary of the Wow! signal, Arecibo Observatory beamed a digital stream towards Hipparcos 34511, 33277, and 43587.[28] The transmission consisted of approximately 10,000 Twitter messages solicited for the purpose by the National Geographic Channel, bearing the hashtag "#ChasingUFOs" (a promotion for one of the channel's TV series).[29] The sponsor also included a series of video vignettes featuring verbal messages from various celebrities.[30]\
\
To increase the probability that any extraterrestrial recipients would recognize the signal as an intentional communication from another intelligent life form, Arecibo scientists attached a repeating-sequence header to each individual message, and beamed the transmission at roughly 20 times the power of the most powerful commercial radio transmitter.[29]}{\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252\cocoartf2577

\f0\fs24 \cf0 Astronomers Discover Mysterious Radio Signal From Proxima Centauri\
Scientists searching for aliens are trying to understand the signal\'92s origins\
\
Scientists detected a mysterious radio signal from a nearby galaxy, which begs the question\'97could it be aliens?\
\
As part of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) program, astronomers working on the Breakthrough Listen project scan for radio signals that could come from some non-human intelligent life in the cosmos. This fall, researchers noticed evidence of a strange radio emission while looking through archival data from 2019. The odd radio emissions seemed to be coming from the direction of Proxima Centauri, the closest neighboring star to our sun at 4.2 light-years away, reports The Guardian's Ian Sample last week.\
\
The scientists behind the discovery explain that there are several potential non-alien explanations for the strange signal. But they have yet to find a terrestrial culprit and have not yet ruled out an extraterrestrial intelligence origin story.\
\
\'93It has some particular properties that caused it to pass many of our checks, and we cannot yet explain it,\'94 Andrew Siemion, Breakthrough Listen\'92s principal investigator, tells Jonathan O\'92Callaghan and Lee Billings for Scientific American.\
\
At the Parkes Observatory in Australia, the team uses a 210-foot-wide radio telescope to study Proxima Centauri. The star system is home to two planets, one of which may be rocky and temperate like Earth. There, they picked up a signal, dubbed BLC-1 after the Breakthrough Listen initiative.\
\
BLC-1 is a narrow beam of around 982 megahertz. This signal is a far narrower frequency than what scientists typically can observe from human-made devices like satellites and spacecraft, according to Scientific American.\
\
Additionally, there is an apparent shift in the beam\'92s frequency, which makes the finding especially compelling because it mimics the drift observed when planets in motion give off signals.\
\
\'93It\'92s the most exciting signal that we\'92ve found in the Breakthrough Listen project, because we haven\'92t had a signal jump through this many of our filters before,\'94 Sofia Sheik, a graduate student at Pennsylvania State University and the Breakthrough team member leading the signal analysis, tells Scientific American.\
\
Though the wobbling frequency helps scientists rule out a terrestrial explanation for the signal, the beam could have come from a travelling satellite or other device. With the large volume of space technology orbiting the Earth and beyond, it can be extremely challenging to pinpoint which signals may be non-human-made, writes astronomer Seth Shostak for SETI.\
\
\'93Our WiFi, our cell towers, our GPS, our satellite radio\'97all of this looks exactly like the signals that we\'92re searching for, which makes it very hard to tell if something is from space or from human-generated technology,\'94 Sheikh tells Nadia Drake for National Geographic.\
\
For nearly four decades, scientists at SETI have searched for signs of extraterrestrial life. In 2015, Silicon Valley investor Yuri Milner and Stephen Hawking began the Breakthrough Initiatives. Using telescopes around the world, astronomers with Breakthrough survey millions of stars closest to Earth, searching for planets in the habitable zone of stars and for transmissions from other intelligent life.\
\
Over the years, astronomers have identified several candidate signals, writes National Geographic. Some led to the discovery of natural phenomena like pulsars\'97quickly rotating neutron stars or white dwarfs that emit electromagnetic radiation beams. Another mysterious low-energy burst of radio waves stumped scientists until they discovered it was no more than a microwave oven in the radio telescope\'92s break room.\
\
\'93All of our SETI experiments are conducted in an absolute sea of interference. There are tons of signals,\'94 Siemion tells National Geographic. \'93It comes down to being able to tell the difference between a very distant technosignature and our own technology.\'94\
\
The team is preparing two papers describing the signal to be published in 2021, according to Scientific American. The detection was leaked to The Guardian before the papers were complete. The researchers have yet to reobserve the signal, but they will continue to focus attention on Proxima Centauri.\
\
\'93There\'92s a lot of talk about sensationalism in SETI,\'94 Siemion tells National Geographic. \'93The reason we\'92re so excited about SETI, and why we dedicate our careers to it, is the same reason why the public gets so excited about it. It\'92s aliens! It\'92s awesome!\'94}{\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252\cocoartf2577

\f0\fs24 \cf0 The Met Office and space weather\
\
The Met Office Space Weather Operations Centre (MOSWOC) is one of three space weather prediction centres around the globe.\
\
Space weather is recognised as a significant potential threat by the UK Government. Solar storms were added to the National Risk Register (NRR) of Civil Emergencies in 2011. MOSWOC provides the vital information to help build the resilience of UK infrastructure and industries in the face of space weather events, thereby supporting continued economic growth.\
\
Current space weather services\
The Met Office provides 24/7 forecasts and warnings of space weather  for Government and responder communities, critical national infrastructure providers and the public and will continue to develop its forecast capability  \
\
For more information, please see Space weather forecasts or view the product catalogue.\
\
Why is space weather such a threat?\
Severe space weather events can have potentially significant impacts on the UK's critical national infrastructure.\
\
The Sun is in constant flux and the impact of this solar activity is more apparent as people become more reliant on technology and systems such as satellites, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), also known as Global Positioning System (GPS), power and radio communications.\
\
Solar flares can cause high-frequency radio and GNSS to perform erratically, extreme CMEs can put power grids at risk. Therefore, space weather prediction is of crucial importance to power companies, satellite operators and the aviation industry.\
\
Space weather impacts\
Low level space weather events occur on a regular basis. So what impacts can they have on our daily lives?\
\
Thankfully, severe space weather events are rare but when they do occur the impacts to our national infrastructure are extremely significant. For this reason, the Government has listed severe space weather as one of the highest priority natural hazards in the UK National Risk Register.\
\
Main impacts at a glance\
The major impacts of a severe space weather event can be divided into two areas - impacts on technology on Earth and threats to equipment and health in space and at high altitude. They include:\
\
Power grid outages\
Disruption to Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) / Global Positioning Satellites (GPS)\
High Frequency (HF) radio communications outages\
Satellite damage\
Increased radiation levels at high altitude\
\
Why are we concerned now?\
Space weather events have always occurred, but our modern reliance on technology driven systems makes us more susceptible to the impacts.\
\
Different systems are exposed to varying levels of risk depending on technical design, location and the type of space weather that can affect them. Our challenge is to ensure new systems are designed with appropriate engineering solutions to minimize the risk posed by space weather.\
\
Industries /infrastructures most at risk from severe space weather\
Energy\
Satellite\
Communications\
Aviation\

Whilst certain impacts (such as degradation of GNSS / GPS) could affect us all, there are specific industries that are more exposed to the threat of space weather. We have been working closely with these industries to identify the threat, the extent of the impacts and to understand how forecasts can help them mitigate the risk.\
\
We provide sector specific forecasts for authorities and organisations that prepare for and respond to risks such as space weather. Access to this service can be requested  - Request space weather account\

\
What is space weather?\
All you need to know about space weather and its impacts.\
\
The most recognisable and visible space weather effect is arguably the auroras (Northern and Southern Lights). However, as well as these spectacular natural phenomena, space weather also represents a real threat and can have an impact upon national infrastructure, technology, and communications systems.\
\
The threat of space weather to national infrastructure, UK industry and the wider public is such that in 2011 it was added to the Government National Risk Register of Civil Emergencies. In response, the Met Office Space Weather Operations Centre (MOSWOC) was created to provide the critical information needed to help protect the country from the serious threats posed by severe space weather events.\
\
What causes space weather?\
Space weather is a consequence of the behaviour of the Sun, the nature of Earth\'92s magnetic field and atmosphere, and our location in the solar system. The active elements of space weather are particles, electromagnetic energy and magnetic fields, rather than the more commonly known weather contributors of water, temperature and air. Magnetic fields, radiation, particles and matter which have been ejected from the Sun can interact with the Earth\'92s magnetic field and upper atmosphere to produce a variety of effects\
\
Types of space weather event\
Space weather conditions vary.  Streams of particles from the Sun carried by the solar wind constantly hit the Earth. During periods of high solar activity, when there are more solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), Earth experiences increased impacts. Extreme events that cause the largest impacts can occur at any time during the 11 year solar cycle.\
\
Coronal mass ejection/Solar flares\
A CME is the ejection of material from the Sun into interplanetary space. If the material is directed towards the Earth then the event may result in a disturbance to the Earth's magnetic field and ionosphere.\
\
Solar flares are the sudden releases of energy across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. They are hard to predict, and the energy can be detected in Earth's atmosphere as soon as 8.5 minutes after the occurrence of a solar flare.\
\
CMEs are often associated with flares. They can take days to reach Earth, carrying a local magnetic field from the Sun, and their arrival time is the focus of space weather forecasting\
\
Radio blackouts\
The ionosphere is a dynamic part of the upper atmosphere which acts as a reflector for long range, high frequency communications (HF comms). During a solar flare the increase in x-ray radiation from the Sun causes the ionosphere to absorb rather than reflect signals and this disrupts communications systems on the sun-lit side of the Earth. The Sun may also emit radio bursts at multiple wavelengths causing various problems for communication and navigation systems.\
\
Even during periods of quiet solar activity turbulence in the ionosphere can result in a scattering of electromagnetic waves disrupting navigation systems like Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) often known as Global Positioning System (GPS) and radio bands up to the GHz frequencies. These are referred to as radio blackouts.\
