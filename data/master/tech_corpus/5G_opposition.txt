Millions of small cells are to be built near our homes in the name of 5G.

 The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) estimates that hundreds of thousands of these wireless antennas will be built in our rights-of-way, directly in front of our homes. 
Communities are being told that it is necessary to build “small cell” towers in neighborhoods in order to offer 5G, a new technology that will connect the Internet of Things (IoT). At every level of government, new legislation aims to streamline (meaning force) the installation of these 5G “small cell” antennas in public rights-of-way.
5G will increase ambient levels of wireless radiofrequency radiation. Peer-reviewed research has demonstrated a myriad of adverse effects from wireless radiofrequency radiation including increased brain cancer, DNA damage, oxidative stress, immune dysfunction,  altered brain development, damaged reproduction, sleep changes, hyperactivity, and memory damage. (RESEARCH HERE)
Thousands of doctors and scientists are calling to halt 5G because of the increase in radiofrequency radiation- a new kind of environmental pollution. (DOCTORS & SCIENTISTS HERE)
 
 
US cities and entire countries are voting to halt 5G. 

Over 600 cities in Italy have passed resolutions to halt 5G until safety research has been completed.  In the United States, Hawaii County passed a resolution to halt 5G as well as Farragut Tennessee and Easton Connecticut. Entire countries like France, Switzerland, and Nigeria are having a national conversation on the safety of 5G and they are launching major investigations to research the issue of safety. (Details HERE)
In the United States, cities such as Petaluma, Mill Valley, Monterey in California, and Doylestown in Pennsylvania have voted and passed policies to halt 5G or restrict the rollout into neighborhoods. 
Los Altos California voted to prohibit the installation of small cells on public utility easements in residential neighborhoods and established a 500-foot setback from a small cell to schools. After the Mayor said the 5G small cells would be an “aesthetic disaster” Palm Beach and other coastal communities got entirely carved out of legislation streamlining the 5G antennas.

5G “small” cell antennas are not “small.”

“Small” cells is an industry word. It means a shorter cell tower close to homes and schools. Each “facility” will have transmitting wireless antennas and often ugly bulky equipment. 
The FCC has estimated over 800,000 new “small” cells to be installed throughout the USA.
Millions are planned worldwide. Antennas will be placed on:
	•	Street lights 
	•	Trashcans 
	•	Utility poles 
	•	Bus stops 
 5G is NOT Faster
Despite the industry message that 5G will be faster, in reality 5G is turning out to be slower. Testing finds 5G in the field is actually nearly the same speed or slower than 4G. It is not working out so well. Read “At this point, 5G is a bad joke” published in Computerworld. “Unless you live or work right next to an mmWave transceiver, you’re simply not going to see those promised speeds or anything close to them.”
5G antennas will  transmit radiation differently
5G will use new “beamforming” antenna designs that create multiple streams of signal from each fixture.
Each installation can have over a thousand antennas that are transmitting simultaneously. 
 
Skyrocketing Energy Consumption 

Engineers say 5G is “an energy hog.” The millions of new short “small” cell towers and over 64 billion IoT devices are expected by 2025. Industry reports repeatedly state that energy efficiency goals will not be fully met, and that energy use from wireless devices and networks will grow exponentially, ever increasing our carbon footprint. Environmental experts warn that the IOT  is  an unsustainable technology and will contribute to climate change. Read more HERE. 
 

 
 
Insurance authorities classify 5G as “High Risk.”

It is standard practice for insurance coverage to exclude health damages from wireless and electromagnetic radiation. The Insurance authority Swiss Re released a white paper classifying 5G as a “high” emerging risk cautioning that “potential claims for health impairments may come with a long latency.” If insurance companies won’t take the risk why should we? 
Legal experts are starting to request that localities get insurance to cover health damages and before rolling out 5G in neighborhoods. 


The radiation from these small cell antennas is not small.

Wireless antennas emit microwaves — non-ionizing radiofrequency radiation — and so these “small” cells essentially function as short cell towers. A 2020 paper analyzed the radio frequency radiation  environment that would result if a  mmWave-based 5G network was fully deployed in Austin Texas and found the radiation levels to be significantly increased. 

Examples of how small cells are not small include:  
	•	They increase electromagnetic radiation near homes.
	•	They have refrigerator-sized (and larger) equipment cabinets.
	•	Property values drop after a cell tower is built near homes.
	•	Taller and wider poles are needed for the antennas.
	•	Fixtures weigh hundreds of pounds.
 

Small cell installations are not the size of pizza boxes.

Each so-called “small” cell installation has antennas on the top and electronics cabinets at the bottom. The electronics are housed in metal boxes – called “street furniture” by industry to make it sound warm and cozy. These cabinets can be larger than a refrigerator, so large people could fit into them. In addition, there will be various radio units, a smart meter, and potentially unseemly wires.   
Most neighborhood light poles are not strong enough to hold the 5G equipment so they will be replaced by much taller wider poles with antennas and 6 ft buzzing boxes. This is called “hardening” the poles, but basically it means the poles will be much wider and thicker metal.  In Montgomery County as an example, the slim 14 ft light poles will be replaced with hefty 24 ft towers with 300-pound antennas and 6 ft buzzing boxes.




.
5G will add an extra layer  — not replace — our current wireless technology.

5G will utilize current 3G and 4G wireless frequencies already in use and also add even more radiation. Higher frequency — submillimeter and millimeter waves — will be used in 5G in order to transmit data at superfast speeds. 

 

5G Networks Could Pose a ‘Major Risk’ to  Airplane  Radar and Weather Prediction

In November 2020 a  white paper by the RTCA, a private-public aviation partnership that advises the Federal Aviation Administration, warns that 5G technologies could pose a “major risk…of harmful interference” to radar on business jets and other civilian aircraft.
If 5G telecommunications systems are permitted to use that frequency band, said the report, “the risk is widespread and has the potential for broad impacts to aviation operations in the US, including the possibility of catastrophic failures leading to multiple fatalities, in the absence of appropriate mitigations.” Read more at 5G Networks Could Pose a ‘Major Risk’ to Your Airplane’s Radar 

In 2019, US Senators  sent a letter urging the FCC to adopt an emission limit recommended by NOAA and NASA citing an internal Navy report that stated the 5G frequencies would probably degrade Naval  weather and ocean models, resulting in increased risk in Safety of Flight and Safety of Navigation, and degraded Battlespace Awareness for tactical / operational advantage. In November 2019, US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper urged the FCC to restrict the 5G spectrum citing  impacts to “national security, civil service, and the economic benefit of the nation” due to the potential for widespread disruption to GPS services.

 
Multiple government reports caution that 5G beam-forming radiation is not easy to measure. 

Imagine increasing an environmental exposure without knowing how to measure it.  The European Parliament report “5G Deployment State of Play in Europe, USA, and Asia” reviews how  “Significant concern is emerging over the possible impact on health and safety arising from potentially much higher exposure to radio-frequency electromagnetic radiation arising from 5G. Increased exposure may result not only from the use of much higher frequencies in 5G but also from the potential for the aggregation of different signals, their dynamic nature, and the complex interference effects that may result, especially in dense urban areas.” “The problem is that currently, it is not possible to accurately simulate or measure 5G emissions in the real world.”

Community authority is being overruled at every level.

Communities are being stripped of their right to make decisions about this new technology. ”Streamlining” means almost automatic approval. Public notice and public hearings are being eliminated. Even if every homeowner on the block opposes the antennas on their street, the opposition will be disregarded with new regulations moving forward at the federal and state level.  
Mayors, city officials, and public officials are joining to call to halt the federal move to “streamline” the small cells rollout.
 

Statement by CEO of U.S. Conference of Mayors 

“The U.S. Conference of Mayors strongly opposes recent proposals by the Federal Communications Commission to grant communications service providers subsidized access to local public property and to dictate how local governments manage their own local rights-of-ways and public property.  This unprecedented federal intrusion into local (and state) government property rights will have substantial adverse impacts on cities and their taxpayers, including reduced funding for essential local government services, as well as an increased risk of right-of-way and other public safety hazards.”
 

 
Scientists worldwide are calling to halt 5G.

Scientists from all over the world have issued a declaration called the 5G Appealcalling for a moratorium on the increase of 5G cell antennas citing human health effects and impacts on wildlife.  
“We recommend a moratorium on the roll-out of the fifth generation, 5G, for telecommunication until potential hazards for human health and the environment have been fully investigated by scientists independent from industry…RF-EMF has been proven to be harmful for humans and the environment.”
In addition to the 5G Appeal, scientific groups are issuing appeals and writing letters warning of the health and environmental impacts of 5G. 


Environmental authorities are cautioning on environmental impacts.


The European Scientific Committee on Health, Environmental, and Emerging Risks (SCHEER) issued a statement identifying emerging issues ( including 5G, E-cigarette, and chronic diseases.) They prioritized 5G impact as “high.”

The SCHEER statement “Potential effects on wildlife of increases in electromagnetic radiation“ states,
“On the horizon, a new generation of even shorter high-frequency 5G wavelengths is being proposed to power the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT promises us convenient and easy lifestyles with a massive 5G interconnected telecommunications network. However, the expansion of broadband with shorter wavelength radio frequency radiation highlights the concern that health and safety issues remain unknown. Controversy continues with regard to harm from current 2G, 3G, and 4G wireless technologies. 5G technologies are far less studied for human or environmental effects” (Russell, 2018).” and concludes, “5G networks will soon be rolled out for mobile phone and smart device users. How exposure to electromagnetic fields could affect humans remains a controversial area, and studies have not yielded clear evidence of the impact on mammals, birds, or insects. The lack of clear evidence to inform the development of exposure guidelines to 5G technology leaves open the possibility of unintended biological consequences.”


Government officials are asking for proof of safety. 

Officials have written to the FCC asking for proof of safety and received “inadequate” responses.
In December of 2019, U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and U.S. Representative Anna G. Eshoo (CA-18) sent a letter to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Commissioner Brendan Carr seeking answers regarding potential health risks posed by new 5G wireless technology. They have been joined by members of Congress from around the country.

Cellular radiation negatively impacts birds and bees 

Published research finds the frequencies impact wildlife. For example, studies have found that the radiation can alter bird navigation and disturb honeybee colonies. Research also shows impacts on trees and plants.

5G Heats Up Base Stations

The circuitry used to generate RF signals uses a lot of power and gets very hot. Base stations need a lot of cooling equipment. “In base stations, which are tightly packed with racks of equipment, thermal buildup can cause all sorts of problems. It can have an impact on signal integrity, and it can reduce the lifespan of all components, states Semiengineering. Michael Foegelle, director of technology development at ETS-Lindgren is quoted iwith his response in Semiengineering explaing that “When you have a frequency with a range that’s not as far as a cell tower, you have to add much more density to the network to get the same amount of connectivity…“When you design these, you have to assume they’ll be outside, and you have to design in a way to dissipate all that. Since you’re outside and don’t want to risk putting in active cooling, you might have to go fix a lot, that means a lot of ambient cooling.” 
The article goes on to details the challenges of 5G and showcases how much engineers have NOT worked out when it comes to 5G and also the potential need for  gallium arsenide (GaAs) to adress the issue which would bring a toxic material into the equipment. Fact: 5G is not ready. 

 
Cumulative daily radiation exposure to wireless radiation is associated with serious health effects. 
5G and 4G cell towers near our homes means constant exposure day and night. You cannot turn a cell tower off.
The public is unaware that peer-reviewed, published science indicates that exposures to wireless radiation can cause cancer,  alter brain development, and damage sperm. Cell tower radiation is also associated with headaches, hormone changes, memory problems, and sleep problems.
A review paper on 5G published in Environmental Research concludes that the current scientific evidence supports the conclusion that mobile phone and wireless radiofrequency radiation (RFR) is cancer-causing. Most people are also unaware that wireless technology was never tested for long-term safety decades ago when the technology was first introduced. Children are more vulnerable to this radiation and that the accumulated scientific evidence shows harmful effects.

Letter by Lennart Hardell MD & Colleagues

“There is a substantial body of evidence that this technology is harmful to humans and the environment. The 5G millimeter wave is known to heat the eyes, skin, and testes… Of particular concern are the most vulnerable among us — the unborn, children, the infirm, the elderly, and the disabled. It is also expected that populations of bees and birds will drastically decline.”

Antennas near homes decrease property values.
Studies show property values drop up to 20% on homes near cell towers. Would you buy a home with a mini cell tower in the yard? 
Read about decreased property value from cell towers near homes. 


Experts state that 5G small cell wireless streaming bills do not make financial sense.  

The California Department of Finance rejected California’s 5G small cell wireless  infrastructure bill S. 649 stating that “Finance opposes this bill… this bill goes too far by usurping city and county zoning authority for infrastructure development, and it potentially imposes reimbursable, state-mandated costs on cities and counties.” 


Microwave antennas in front yards present several worker and public safety issues.

Unions have already filed comments that workers were injured, unaware they were working near transmitting antennas. How will HVAC workers, window washers, and tree cutters be protected? The heavy large equipment cabinets mounted on poles along our sidewalks also present new hazards. Cars run into utility poles, often, what then?

Fiber is the solution and the safe alternative.

Worldwide, many regions are investing in wired fiber optic connections which are safer, faster, more reliable, provide greater capacity, and are more cyber-secure. Read“Re-Inventing Wires: The Future of Landlines and Networks,” by the National Institute for Science, Law & Public Policy


 
Wireless companies warn investors of risks but neglect to inform consumers and neighbors living near towers. 

Crown Castle (a company building small cell infrastructure throughout the USA) has a statement in their 2016 10-K Annual Report that says:
“If radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our wireless infrastructure are demonstrated to cause negative health effects, potential future claims could adversely affect our operations, costs, or revenues… We currently do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters.” 
Read the warnings from Wireless companies.

Many countries have more protective cell tower radiation limits compared to the USA. 

Countries such as China, India, Poland, Russia, Italy, and Switzerland have far more protective and stricter radiation limits than do we in the United States. According to industry reports, these countries’ more protective radiation limits will not allow the full deployment of 5G because the increased 5G radiation would exceed these governments allowable levels of radiation. The Report “The impact of RF-EMF exposure limits stricter than the ICNIRP or IEEE guidelines on 4G and 5G mobile network deployment” reviews how 5G deployment is “constrained” by these countries’ limits. In addition, these stricter exposure limits are also considered problematic for the full rollout of 4G LTE.  as detailed in a GSMA report.  




 
No one is monitoring radiation exposures from these cell installations and many cell towers are in violation of the radiation limits. 

Although several countries have regular monitoring of wireless radiation limits, the US does not.  The Wall Street Journal did an investigative report in 2014 examining over 5,000 cell antennas sites and found that 1 in 10 sites violated the rules during safety audits for carriers and local municipalities “underscoring a safety lapse,” yet the FCC has issued just two citations to cell carriers since 1996 because “the FCC says it lacks resources to monitor each antenna.” A CBS Atlanta investigation also found radiation excesses up to 400 percent of the limit close up to the antennas on rooftop posing serious health risks especially to any worker coming on the roof.  

The American Academy of Pediatrics is one of many medical organizations calling to reduce children’s exposure. 

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), our largest organization of children’s doctors, has repeatedly written to the US  government that current regulations on cellular radiation are outdated and non-protective for children and pregnant women. They recommend parents learn how to reduce children’s cell phone radiation exposure. 
The American Academy of Pediatrics webpage on Cell Towers states: 
“An Egyptian study confirmed concerns that living nearby mobile phone base stations increased the risk of developing: 
	•	Headaches 
	•	Memory problems 
	•	Dizziness 
	•	Depression 
	•	Sleep problems” 
NASA to build a 4G mobile network on the moon.

So now the moon is going to have better reception than my house??

Thank god they didn't go for 5G. We wouldn't want to spread the Coronas on the moon! By the time we actually need that network it may seem like the Pony Express being setup for today’s world.

What's the point really? There's no atmosphere so wouldn't solar radiation just overwhelm the signal?

Maybe it will be used as a network that AI robots could use to communicate with.

Hi-communication of VR quality can be had with line-of-sight lasers, with relays around unchanging geographical features through clear vacuum.

So far NASA hasn't done a thing on the moon since Apollo ended. That's sure a lot of nothing for surely a shit ton of announcements over the last 40 years.

Please just give people healthcare and stop wasting money like that OMG capitalism is so useless, make something useful for humanity.

Erm...shouldn't we worry about like...oxygen there first? Or you know...a permanent residence w/ protection from the solar wind before we worry about the internet there?

I don't think they're worrying but more so proof of concept and claims for $$

DO THE BENEFITS OUTWEIGH THE HARMS?
Will millions of wireless antennas on earth, tens of thousands of satellites filling our skies complemented by thousands of Earth-Based Stations and millions of User-Terminals, billions of sensors and cameras squeezing from our world every “bit” of data imaginable, provide overall benefit or harm to our infinitely fine-tuned web of life?
As digitalization spirals out of control in an ever-expanding web of technology gone rogue, perhaps it’s time to consider whether the harms outweigh the hoped for and hyped about benefits.
Below is a brief overview of why people around the world are sounding the alarm about 5G and calling for safer wired technology.

HEALTH
5G is a massive biological experiment inflicted on the public without informed consent, with no prior safety testing, and with credible scientific evidence indicating this technology will prove harmful to health and potentially fatal to some.

Once 4G/5G antennas are densely installed in communities around the globe and interacting with tens of thousands of satellites polluting our skies, no one will be able to escape continuous, involuntary exposure to non-ionizing radiation. The unborn child, young children, the elderly, and people with chronic illnesses, microwave sickness, or compromised immune systems will be particularly vulnerable.
The 2015 International EMF Scientist Appeal. signed by more than 240 scientists with published peer-reviewed research on the biologic and health effects of wireless radiation states:
“Numerous recent scientific publications have shown that EMF affects living organisms at levels well below most international and national guidelines. Effects include increased cancer risk, cellular stress, increase in harmful free radicals, genetic damages, structural and functional changes of the reproductive system, learning and memory deficits, neurological disorders, and negative impacts on general well-being in humans. Damage goes well beyond the human race, as there is growing evidence of harmful effects to both plant and animal life.”
Our children depend on us and on government leaders around the globe to protect health and safety and to place these above all else.
Many animals and plants depend on Earth’s magnetic field for navigation, breeding, food, migration and indeed survival. Recently reported research shows current levels of artificial radiation are already interfering with these biological processes.

“Biologists have discovered that wireless electromagnetic radiation disturbs internal magneto-receptors used for navigation, as well as disrupting other complex cellular and biologic processes in mammals, birds, fish, insects, trees, plants, seeds and bacteria with profound impacts on the natural environment” Cindy Russell, Physicians For Safe Technology.
Radiation has also been implicated in Colony Collapse Disorder. The shorter millimeter wave frequencies that will be used for 5G will be yet more perilous than 2G, 3G, and 4G, as insects are millimeter-sized creatures and will selectively absorb and amplify these frequencies.
We interfere with nature at our own peril.
Enabled by millions of new 4G/5G antennas, the Internet of Things (IoT), Smart Cities, and Smart Regions will generate an extraordinary amount of data. As Surveillance Capitalism expert Sue Halpern explains,

“5G will catalogue exactly where someone has come from, where they are going, and what they are doing.” Sue Halpern | The New Yorker. The Terrifying Potential of the 5G Network.
Our data will be collected, mined, analyzed, and stored indefinitely in data centers. It will be sold and used for targeted marketing (aka surveillance capitalism), surveillance, law enforcement, research, smart cities systems, and more as the IoT evolves. In fact, a whole interconnected system is being built as data from one application provides fodder for another.
Data of course will also be used by hackers for their purposes as wireless systems are far more easily hacked than wired connections.
Our data is extraordinarily valuable and can be used for research, profit, surveillance, and control. Data is one of the main driving forces behind 5G and an all-things-connected world.
Research shows technology has profound psycho-social effects. Suicide, loneliness, and depression are reaching epidemic proportions. Professor Jean Twenge from San Diego State University says “Young people are on the brink of the worst mental health crisis in decades.”

Tech-addiction is on the rise. Gaming Disorder is now included in the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases. Teenagers are showing signs of addiction from watching screens nine hours per day, while being exposed to non-ionizing radiation from Wi-Fi and devices. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that doctors prescribe “creative unplugged play-time” for children. The need for such a recommendation is a sad commentary on the current state of affairs.
Our kids need more time with one another and in nature, and less with technology and screens. 5G will worsen the problem of dependence on, and addiction to technology.
We have allowed industry to define who we are, what we do, and where we are headed as a species. We and our children deserve better. We don’t need more internet-connectivity, we need more connection.
Armed with an astronomical amount of data generated from the 5G-enabled Internet of Things (IoT), Smart Cities, and Smart Regions, industry claims we will be better equipped to save energy. But what they fail to include in their analyses is the mega energy footprint of all these internet-connected things humming and buzzing 24/7. It is not at all clear that the IoT will ever succeed in offsetting its own fast growing and unbounded energy footprint.

Not considered are:
	1.	The energy consumed by all the constantly-communicating “things” machines, applications, sensors, surveillance cameras, etc.
	2.	The astronomical amount of energy needed to manufacture all these IoT things, devices and accompanying infrastructure (embodied energy).
	3.	The CO2 released into the atmosphere from the energy used to power the proliferating wireless sources. Most of this energy is generated from fossil fuels.
	4.	The energy required to power enormously energy consumptive data centers.
	5.	The excess energy needed to move data wirelessly through the air rather than more efficiently and effectively through fiber or cable.
An all-things-connected world is not the answer to saving energy.
With the Internet of Things (IoT), household items such as washing machines, mattresses, tea kettles, plant-waterers etc. join the ranks of e-waste. Will recycling be enough, and will Earth be able to “digest” this fast-growing volume of e-waste?

In a Business World article, Nurit Kanti explains: “With lack of proper barriers to prevent this leakage [of toxic substances], and the high concentration of these toxic substances, the impact of the e-waste on the ecosystem is extremely long-lasting, irreversible and dangerous to the sustainability of everyone around that eco-system.”
E-waste from discarded products is only part of the problem. A far more significant contributor to e-waste is the release of toxins from mining and manufacturing electronics. In an article in The Conversation, author Josh Lepawsky explains, “No amount of post-consumer recycling can recoup the waste generated before consumers purchase their devices.”
A Swedish study by Avfall Sverige explained that the “invisible waste” from a smartphone and laptop is about 86 and 1,200 kilograms respectively, compared to 1 kilogram of beef and a pair of cotton trousers, which generate 4 and 25 kilograms respectively.
“They’re digging in trenches and laboring in lakes, hunting for treasure in a playground from Hell. Hard enough for an adult man. Unthinkable for a child.” CBS News finds children mining cobalt for batteries in the Congo.

The production of our electronic technologies has fueled war, murder, rape, and child labor in the Congo. According to World Without Genocide at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law, approximately 6 million people have died as a result conflicts fueled by the pursuit of rare earth minerals needed for our electronics.
Children and women also suffer. Unicef estimated that in 2016, there were about 40,000 children working in mines across the Congo. Hundreds of thousands of women have been raped and sold back to villages for ransom. Casualties of a war financed primarily by the electronics industry.
5G and the Internet of Things will likely bring more hardship, child labor, and deaths as the industry driven push for an all-things-connected world consumes and ravages us and Earth.
The World Global Research Report ranked cyber security as the third greatest global risk in 2018 topped only by natural disasters and extreme weather events. With the arrival of the IoT and billions of new internet-connected machines, appliances, sensors, things, robots, devices, etc. – all enabled and supported by 5G – cyber-attacks have become virtually inevitable. Furthermore, a wireless system is far more vulnerable to cyber-attacks than a wired system.

Cyber security expert, Bruce Schneier states: “With the advent of the Internet of Things and cyber-physical systems in general, we’ve given the Internet hands and feet: the ability to directly affect the physical world. What used to be attacks against data and information have become attacks against flesh, steel, and concrete.”
Restated: “Give the Internet hands and feet, and it will have the ability to punch and kick.
Thankfully, there is a safer, more reliable, tried and true solution that we have had for well over 20 years -fiber/wired technology. If we used wired connections for the vast majority of internet and telecommunications needs, reserving wireless for an ancillary service — we could enjoy the benefits of technology while minimizing the harms.
Wired technologies such as fiber or coaxial cable are faster, more reliable, resilient, energy-efficient, and more easily defended from cyber attacks. Above all, wired technologies are significantly less hazardous to our health and would better ensure the survival of other life forms with whom we share this planet.
I’m not worried about the health side effects, but that’s based of what I learned in college when I was studying physics. What I am worried about is the era of the internet of things. Gotta say, Watchdogs 2 seems like a warning. Once they implement 5G and eventually facial recognition, coupled with your personal facebook profile digital signature and the fact people don’t rely on physical currency these days... Yeah it seems pretty likely they’re up to no good.

I am worried about the health. There was a great video, a week ago, about the lack of care when the producer doesn’t have a personal relationship with the consumer. During the Victorian period, it let to thousands or hundreds of thousands of deaths from adulteration of food.
We see the same thing with cancer causing agents in ALL of our consumer products.
This is just another step.
With that being said, the purpose of 5g is to invade privacy. It to have a device in everything we have. Our paper, our pens, our cars, our fridges, our children’s toys, our driveways, our lights, our TVs.
5 G is the network that allows for the processing of all these devices.
I know for a fact we won’t see to much of an I cream either in our lives, after all, I have gigabyte tv and internet and I have outages and shit problems all the time. My ISP is not interested in fixing it.

the purpose of 5g is to invade privacy.
i think it might be worse...


Like you, I am more concerned about the privacy, manipulation and abuse of the internet and current technology than health issues, which I understand there are none from 4G and 5G.

there are enough health issues to be worried. Non ionizing radiation is still bad for your brain. Nobody wants a low powered microwave strapped to their head all day. An antenna every 100 feet will not be healthy.
violently vibrates molecules
Otherwise known as heat.
Microwave ovens operate at 2.45 GHz because that's the frequency that causes the hydrogen atoms to vibrate all violently.
What frequencies does 5G operate on?

What if I heat something with artificial infrared radiation?
Equally scary?
Toasters are pretty frightening.

You're just using semantics to make your point sound scarier.

Just wait until they compare it to the sun, no joke I see it all the fucking time.
Edit: LOL holy shit someone just did it right below me hahaha https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/d84cks/thousands_of_swiss_protest_5g_wireless_over/f1a7jyh/

You assume they are not poisoning our food?

You'd better avoid indirect sunlight as well, because it's magnitudes more powerful than 5G.
We literally have that now already. What do you think wi-fi is? Current cell phones? Hell the processor in your PC or laptop is outputting more.
All of which i avoid. But how do i avoid 100's of microwave antennae on every street corner? There is no choice,and no voting. We all have the right to walk around unharmed and 5G contradicts that right. The fact that people argue against that right is suspect.
How do you avoid it? Unless you live on a private island with no access to the internet, how? What are you typing your replies on right now?

Faraday cage

Lmao 😂 I must be fucked then bc got all this TECH around me

I'm a computer engineer, lol, my whole life is RF frequency. I'm more at risk from getting heat stroke from the server room than I am from getting poisoned by RF frequencies.
I dont put my PC on my face. I dont have Wifi. Havent seen my cellphone for days. Yes my house has wires, but what can I do about that? Cut the breaker every night? Maybe I should?
I'm a lot like you, never really used wifi and never got a smartphone. I can't do anything about neighbors and the big cell tower I worked under for almost a decade. https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jul/20/man-living-alone-woods-escape-wifi-mobiles This guy hits the nail on the head with this quote ""I've been through hellishly desperate times with this," he says. "People don't believe that EMFs are the cause of EHS and it gets you in such a state. You're battling for your existence and people think it's all in your head.""
Even my own family turned against me for the first year I was researching. I saved up enough to buy meters and began studying building biology type work. I can only measure 1hz up to 3.0ghz, which covers ALMOST everything except 5G, and 5Ghz(wi-fi, wi-max)
You can measure your body voltage with a simple AC voltmeter. ground the black(COM) lead, thumb and index finger on red lead. Move body close to wall where power is running. Make sure it's below 0.6 where you sleep. This is only for low frequency EMF. I have other meters to measure this but they cost hundreds of dollars. Some people ground their beds, or 'earthing beds'.
High frequencies can be mitigated with faraday screens. Right now I'm using brite unpainted aluminum screen wire mesh. I'm making my own suit because I can't afford the protection gear being sold.
Good luck friend I should have more to share by the end of the year.

Do you plan to hug the 5g antennas daily? You think just because it isn't planted on your face you are somehow safe from it? The radio waves aren't limited to the dimensions of the device, lol.
Haha those sources are a joke. Show us ONE peer-reviewed study from a AA journal or higher and we can talk.
Exactly this. This is what people who proclaim 5G is safe are totally missing. The very fact that we have no long term studies is a reason in itself to not go ahead with this. Things that cause harm tend to have an accumulative effect. For example you could do a 2 year study on the impacts of smoking..you will not see the complete damage at this stage, yet fast forward 20 years and it can eventually kill someone. They once told us smoking was safe and actually GOOD for you. Unfortunately we tend to find out the truth once it’s too late

There are longterm studies. Many. Many. Many. Like I mentioned in another post. Electromagnetic fields are literally being studies since 70 years. I know you are gonna say now: "Well but we have 4G since 2010, 9 years is not really long term study". Yeah well, there are also no studies about what happens if you eat M&M's for 50 years straight, but that doesn't mean that the underlying effects, physical properties are so well understood that you can more or less predict what the effects are in 5, 10 or 20 years.

link one of the so called studies you speak of, clown
There aren't any recent studies because the existing ones already cover it.
Sure, unless you live under one of the cell towers, the chances are slim that you will experience negative effects. The cell phone even in the 5G spectrum doesn't even come close to the RF you experience daily as it is. Here are two articles:
"Although RF radiation does not cause cancer by damaging DNA in cells the way ionizing radiation does, there has been concern that some forms of non-ionizing radiation might have biological effects that could result in cancer in some circumstances." - from your second article

Concerns which the article then goes on to address. The concerns are from people like yourself.

""might" have biological effects that "could"" is not proof. That is the problem, people don't know how to discern what they're reading anymore. That absolutely does not prove that you get cancer from radio waves, that sounds more like we have no idea and there isn't enough data to show cause and effect.

“Much of the Scientific Literature, Perhaps HALF, May Simply Be Untrue” … “It Is Simply No Longer Possible To Believe Much of the Clinical Research That Is Published. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of The New England Journal of Medicine.” -Dr. Marcia Angell
Big pharma manipulates and manufactures their own studies to support their agenda. I'm not sure why you would invalidate independent studies or alternative sources.
Literally what you just described is tribulation and the mark of the beast. Be aware. The world has removed what the church has known

Does someone have information about 4g linked to mass honey-bee deaths? I remember reading it at some point. My question is: how are these systems affecting smaller organisms such as honey-bees, micro-organisms, etc. I know there hasn't really been any long-term studies done, but I'm genuinely curious if it will impact other organisms WORSE than humans.

There are newer studies coming out within the next year so keep an eye out for those. The studies on eyeballs are interesting but you have to read the data, associated with increased light sensitivity. I can't remember how bees vision works, can they see some UV? Yes they can (https://www.beeculture.com/bees-see-matters/)
edit: Apparently their vision is higher 'frames per second' than a human, this article says. Cool stuff, I'm not sure if that means you would notice vision impairment/light sensitivity in bees before humans or not...
edit2: (visual aid https://youtu.be/N1TUDFCOwjY?t=88) "Every super hero has at least one side-kick and a bee’s pal is light. Light is defined as the electromagnetic energy we can see. Humans generally see in the 700 to 400 nanometer range of the spectrum, while bees can see from the 600 to 300 nm range. The 400 to 300 nm section of the spectrum includes ultraviolet light Studies have shown that if deprived of ultraviolet light, bees lose interest in foraging and will remain in the hive until they are forced out by starvation and severe food shortages. UV light, which can penetrate cloud cover, is critical in a bee’s ability to find nectar. "
So I remembered there is a connection with aluminum and bees as well. The 'geoengineering' programs going on are shown to have much higher ppm aluminum as fuel additives, and the silver iodide, aluminum, 'cloud seeding'. Lots of other nasty chemicals/toxic metals that can harm bees. AND SHABAM http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/the-dwindling-population-of-bees-and-aluminum-levels/ I hope all the little bees can survive this onslaught.
edit3: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127665#sec001 <-- the actual study. The article above has some comments and one of them mentions the aluminum present in jet fuel additives (JP8).

Also maybe search about being able to actually hear your phones data stream 4g though some brands of noise canceling headsets. Had this problem once sometimes my noise canceling headset picked up my 3g/4g it would blast my ears and hurt. If I was a bee and heard that coming from all directions I would be confused AF and fucking leave too.
You can use the meter HF35C from gigahertz solutions, it has a speaker so you can hear the differences in the signals. It's about $400 bucks. I'm going to try to get my local library to have some of these meters available to rent.

Technically, we don't know the long-terms effects of 3G or 4G. Maybe the symptoms start showing up in a few years, maybe they're already here but haven't been connected. 5G ramps up the exposure
Like, a casual cigar every so often probably won't hurt much, but living in a smoking lounge will
As if telecom companies care, tho

Or there May be none
There’s certainly not NO harmful effects. As a society we’re playing a game where we decide how much radiation exposure is worth it for Instagram. I think a lot of people draw the line at 5g myself included.
edit- some sources below: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935118303475

That’s not how radiation works though. Ionizing radiation, like UV and X-Rays, is what’s dangerous, it can tear the electrons off atoms and destroy DNA. Lower energy radiation, like radio waves, microwaves, and visible light don’t have enough energy to shatter molecules, the only affect they have on you is heating you up.
A lot of our communications are done through radio waves, very long-wavelength, low-energy radiation capable of penetrating matter without interacting with it. 5G is comprised of microwaves, which are slightly higher in energy, and less penetrating. That’s why 5G is only viable in cities, the wavelength used cannot travel long distances through the atmosphere, it will interact with the air and get absorbed.
I’ve heard some people compare 5G to a microwave oven. While microwaves absolutely can heat things up when they’re absorbed, it takes an 800+ Watt power supply to do it, no phone is capable of putting out that kind of power. It’s akin to comparing a flashlight to the sun, because they both produce visible light.
TLDR: 5G uses microwaves that are lower in energy than visible light. If the radiation from 5G were dangerous, that would also mean that visible light was even more dangerous.
The phones wont be 800 watts, but how many watts are the antennae that are placed every 100 feet? What wattage are you comfortable strapping to your head? Call me crazy, but I wont be casually walking around neighborhoods with these antennas everywhere.

For an analogy, consider a 120 Watt light bulb. Visible light is higher energy than microwaves, and yet you can’t feel any heat from a typical light bulb unless you’re inches away from it. With non-ionizing radiation like visible light and microwaves, the only effect they will realistically have on matter is heating it up, so if you can’t feel any heat then it’s not going to hurt you.
I actually missed a part with my microwave oven comparison. It’s not just that the power supply is so much larger, it’s also that it’s highly confined. In a microwave oven the radiation is reflected by the metal walls and oscillates inside the box, while an antennae has no such confinement. If you were to take the microwave source out of the appliance and use it in the open, it would be much less effective at heating things, even though the amount of energy contained in the microwave beam hasn’t changed.

From a RF book but in a free space condition, the strength of signal per m² decreases by 75% every time you double in distance. And devices dont need to catch an enourmous amplitude to extract the information

Take one out of a microwave and point it at your head. You won't like it. Now imagine one every 100'. Right beside your head, cause they'll be on every corner.
Except that microwaves are magnitudes more powerful than 5G.

No, the "G" in "5G" doesn't stand for "5Ghz".
It stands for "5th Generation".
Everything is harmful. Life is shortened by literally everything. You can draw the line where you want.. that is absolutely your right. The fact remains however. There is no evidence to suggest that any of the things being spouted as potential effects of 5g are even remotely true. Each to their own
Everything you said I agree with, except the 5g harmful effects. There are lots of studies that show 5g radiation is harmful to humans, and also lots of studies showing the regular 3g/LTE networks are harmful too.
That's why you've linked so many sources and so much proof right?
There's not one. I checked myself. The ones that claim to be cannot back up one of their claims which is why they are not peer reviewed
That's not how society is supposed to work. Link a study that proves it to be safe, then it can be allowed. Apparently americans didn't learn anything from asbestos, tobacco, DDT, etc. SAFETY SHOULD BE PROVEN FIRST.

Anyone with basic understanding of physics can tell you why it's safe. What you need is evidence that our understanding of physics is wrong.

It's not just "physics". You have to know biology, microbiology, biochemistry, bioelectricity, etc. as well. It's not as simple as physics being wrong or right. There isn't a single study out there that proves wireless technology is safe for all living creatures.
Check out my collection and the wiki at electromagnetics subreddit.

It's not that you have to prove that wireless technology is safe for all living creatures, it's that you would have to prove why wireless technology is dangerous when visible light isn't.

There's actually a lot, this is a good starting point for 5g research:

Please tell me you are not being serious?
What? Why? I thought the link had many other links with great information. Like this for example:
In 2017, when 5G “small cells were coming to California via a 5G streamlining bill (SB649), firefighter organizations came out in strong opposition to the bill and cited the many peer-reviewed studies. They requested that 5G towers not be installed on firehouses. They were successful and SB649 was amended to exempt their stations from the deployment due to their health concerns.
Show me these peer review studies then

check again
link a peer reviewed article please


Those are articles. Not peer reviewed papers by people that are actual experts or academics. This is nonsense by lunatics.

Most definitely a shilled topic, but I find the best way to combat it is well reasoned, respectful debate. Shills try to devolve the conversation and get you off track, hold the course and keep the knowledge flowing.


No. Just no. It's not ionizing radiation. You might as well say we don't know the long-term effects of fucking LEDs or something.

Oh give me a fucking break. Why not actually, you know, read one of the links in that half-arsed Google search of yours? Here's a quote, from one of those links.
These and other arguments were rejected in a study published by CELMA, the Federation of European Lighting Companies.
One of the main arguments addressed by the study was that LED-based lighting results in short blue light waves that can cause health problems.
The study therefore focused on comparing the photo-biological safety of LED-based light sources to non-LED light sources.
The main conclusion of the study was that LED-based lighting sources are as safe to use as incandescent bulbs and fluorescent bulbs and that the amount of blue light emitted from them is no different than that emitted from non-LED light sources.
By the way, I'm not claiming that LEDs are absolutely 100% safe (and neither is the aforementioned study), my point was that there's far worse things out there.
5G is the same, nothing's 100% safe, merely opening your eyes causes eye damage, going outside causes skin damage, arguing with morons gives me brain damage.
The point is, 5G is non-ionizing radiation, just like visible light, any long-term or cumulative damage if it exists is going to be completely blown out of the water by merely sitting down and basking in the earth's natural ionizing background radiation, a completely unavoidable carcinogen that kills you just for existing.
This turned into a rant and wasn't necessarily aimed at you, but I hope it puts things in to perspective for others.


It is simply amazing to me how little people know about the world we live in. I'm glad the epidemic of ignorance didn't touch all of us yet. Thank you.

surely the ceos and higher level engineers know. Do they live in undergound bunkers

Billionaires are more sheltered than the average person will ever realize

They eat at restaurants and drive cars and exist in the same world. They have smart phones. You think they wouldn't be affected? What about the engineers that are actually designing building and implementing this? They're too stupid to know?

That's like asking if people are too stupid to know that pollution will affect the entire planet: they're far away enough that it will either
	•	not reach them within their lifetime or 
	•	it'll be a big enough problem that somebody solves it at least in their mind 
In the meantime, they couldn't care less until there's profit to be made


5g will reach everywhere 4g does right?

Richer people who already have good reception will require less towers and inherently be exposed less
Keep in mind that when I say rich, I refer to the superrich, the kind of people behind dark money and faceless corporations. The kind of people that when they get indicted, the general public goes "who?" and moves on to the next story.
The kind of people that raise "affluenza teens", and push(ed) for opioids, who are measured not just by how money much they have, but how much money they know about

The engineers who are building and deploying know full well the capabilities. What about them?
Seems dumb, deploy something dangerous t hat goes literally everywhere you want to be


People need their jobs, and if the long term effects are unknown or understated anyone involved can justify it "not being that bad". That or the higher ups could just say so, and the workers follow
There were engineers behind fossil fuels and fracking, too. Behind hair spray, and nicotine. Turns out, if a corporation or other big business can profit, new evidence and unexplored long term effects don't factor into the calculation of what's safe

Actually, 5G ramps down the exposure.

Lower strength but more points of exposure. That's what I mean by cigars versus smoking Lounge, the constant "second hand smoke* could be worse than the occasional "driving past a cell tower"

Well by that definition, the visible light around us all the time is the biggest smoking lounge of all. And it's stronger than the "smoke" coming from 5G as well.


And thanks to pollution aka the cause of climate change, doctors recommend wearing sunscreen almost everyday due to fluctuating levels of UV radiation. The tobacco industry is actually a perfect example of how big businesses will know something is harmful long before most people, and work to define a "safe exposure" as to hold onto profits as long as possible
The people responsible don't care if, or when they die, as long as they can live richer, more powerful, and longer than the average 'peasant'

The class actions have begun: https://www.chicagotribune.com/investigations/ct-cell-phone-radiation-lawsuit-apple-samsung-met-20190829-ye5h7fw6yvauxpo367vqeg7pju-story.html If this goes through, it will open a lot of doors for all of us.

I'm sure it'll be protected by some intermediary court so you can't take action against them. Just like vaccines.

Then go for it. If you are so sure you ca. Prove your case beyond reasonable doubt, get a load of people together and launch a class action lawsuit.


If emitting RF is going to cause harm to health, then the concern should have been long ago since 5G is going to be much higher frequency and can't even penetrate skin. AM radio, for example, is much lower frequency and if RF did cause harm, it would almost surely be around these frequencies or lower, not at the frequencies 5G emits. Hell 3G and 4G are much lower frequency than 5G.
Not really sure where the 5G hysteria started, but honestly it's really stupid. We already have been getting blasted by RF all over by different frequencies since we were ALL born.


Exactly and quite literally from birth. Medical equipment for decades has operated on the 3.2 GHz ISM band, same with military frequency. I wonder if these people are reading and/or writing these articles over wi-fi? If they are, oh geez, they're in huge trouble.

Yep. This was also shown to be Russian propaganda because they have no stake in the 5G market not money to upgrade their infrastructure. They need to cause fear or they'll fall behind.

No that was a NYT hit piece on RT. Verizon owns at least 15% of NYT and NYT even disclosed they paid for the article. Ajit Pai is a former corporate lawyer for Verizon. Don't listen to those stooges, do your own research and follow the money.

wow what a SHIThole
Anyone ever turn their phone on to "airplane" mode before bed? I read on a different post to try that out, and I have actually been getting full nights of sleep without waking up every 2 hours since I started doing that. Makes you wonder wtf is going on with these phones... Or maybe it is some kind of placebo affect going on i dunno. Glad to be sleeping again either way.


Now try shutting of your wifi at night.

I had to pull the wireless module out of my friends smart TV because even when he had it off it would still broadcast and pulse (probably SSID). I use this meter for wi-fi and cellular detection/measurements. https://www.gigahertz-solutions.de/en/measurement/high-frequency/meters/312/hf35c
It's bi-axial and directional so it helps me set up proper faraday screening.


Thanks for the info. I really think it is important to be careful with the wifi and other artificial EM-radiation.

Yeah we don't have immune system set up to deal with it. The radio and TV are modulated so your body might be able to work around those. We are pretty much all part of some great experiment I guess, stay safe everyone.


Not to make fun, but this reminds me of Chuck from Better Call Saul

And, did you also notice something changing with your sleep or overall level of Energy and positivity?

Thanks for the feedback, i also have a more "peace full" feeling after i had shut down my wifi and such.

Airplane mode and turning off WiFi at night is a great idea- but of course it still won't protect you from the ambient waves of the cell network that's always there, or neighbours wifi.
I think the answer is an insulated bedroom as the 5g rollouts happen.


Makes you wonder wtf is going on with these phones
Nah, just keeps me consistently amazed at the power of the placebo effect :)

This is smart. It is better to wait until 5G has been used in other countries for several years or decades to see if any problems arise.


Affects of microwave wavelength e.m. on neural networks, that is a legitimate concern...
Our neurons are not just neuroelectrochemical, but electromagnetic too.
Potentially very dangerous, 5g could become.


Do you know why they said no to it?

The city of Brussel is stopping all tests until further research is done. I know nothing about Poland.

Yes that’s fine exactly correct

Everbody whos saying "There's not enough research"... well, you're wrong there is plenty of research. In fact there are whole Institutes, just researching this since 50 years (in the case of the Swiss based Institute of Electromagnetic Fields in Zurich). Here is the deal, 5g is safe. End of story. There is evidence that your phone can heat up tissue when its in close proximity to your head. However, there is no evidence that this somehow bad. It might be. But it probably isn't.

How can something approaching microwave levels of radiation, and attached to multiple devices in every home, be PERFECTLY safe.
There are absolutely consequences. The current debate is not IF it's bad, it's HOW bad the radiation is.

You cannot make such a bold statement and say 5G is safe. You don’t know that, no one does. How can you make those claims when we haven’t been exposed to it in it’s full capacity and for a sustained period of time? I’d be interested to see these research papers, links?
Now let's see where the goalpost moves to.
While this does show that 2/3/4G frequencies can cause tumors, they are saying that 5G doesn’t penetrate the skin like the older technologies did, but 5G will still be using the older frequencies at times. The question remains, will all the extra amplification needed to make 5G work, have an impact on the penetration of these higher frequencies into the human body.
They also say they don't know what cause cancer using 2g 3g so it's not like they can make an educated guess on 5g,they literally don't know why it happens.

It also kills bees :( all cellular devices do....

The argument against it seems to be: "There was no research on this topic, except a bunch of clandestine black budget stuff to develop a super fast communication network that also has conspiracy related effects. Also, somehow the US and China developed this secret technology in parallel."

I’ve been told that anyone who questions 5G is a kook.
But the Swiss aren’t known for being kooks.
Or maybe they are, I don’t know – but this seems reasonable enough.
And “thousands” is a big number. It’s hard to find thousands of kooks outside of an American right-wing conference.Basically, I think there probably are some pretty serious concerns about how this could effect the nervous system, the brain and the general health of the population, and that these concerns are being completely dismissed.
A big part of this is that there are two major conspiracy theories being associated with 5G:
That it is a government plot to use electromagnetic waves to control people’s brains That it is a plot by the Chinese to spy on people People hear those stupid type kook theories, then they just don’t want to hear anything else, as they think anyone talking about potential problems with this technology must be a kook.
But the fact is, there isn’t enough research. We don’t know about this technology. Some of the research indicates there could be problems. And we don’t really even know what problem we’re solving here. I live in a third world country and my LTE internet is as fast as I believe is necessary.
And we still don’t really know the effects of current cellphone technology.It doesn’t appear to be causing cancer, as was wondered about. But it could be contributing to male infertility. And it could be causing depression and general psychological or even physical fatigue. There are already very powerful electromagnetic waves surrounding us at all hours of the day, kids, and I don’t think saying “maybe we should think about this, possibly do a bit more research” makes someone a kook.
As part of the nervous system, the brain is effectively an electromagnetic organ.Are we able to image a world where we have the current level of internet on our home computers, but still have to use a payphone if we want to contact someone when we’re outside of our home?
And the only access to the internet outside of our homes and workplace is in public internet cafes?
Can anyone make any argument whatsoever as to how such a world would not be better than the one we have right now?
And that is without even going into any of these questions about health, which as I say, I think are very valid.
The problem with our society is that we do not have any values, or belief about the nature of man beyond that his purpose is to make money and entertain himself. All consumer technology makes money by allowing people to entertain themselves, so we are told we must assume that all consumer technology is good.
And the response to a lot of people is to go full Luddite and start talking about bringing down the entire system.But if you had a science and data drive society, where studies were done to answer obvious questions and the state and industry was then built along those lines, all would be well.
Right now, we have all of these supposed ideologies, all of which simply boil down to money and pleasure, nothing to do with sustainability, long term individual human contentment, the protection of future generations or indeed man’s search for meaning.
We should do away with ideologies completely, and simply return to the data, and we will do fine. Ideologies are invented by Jews, governments and charlatans and sold to and promoted by stupid, gullible people.
On the issue of cellphone technology, why not simply ask:
Are cellphones benefitting the overall health of society (communities, families, relationships, the wellbeing of the individual)? If so, how? What data do we have to support that? Are cellphones harming the overall health of society (communities, families, relationships, the wellbeing of the individual)? If so, how? What data do we have to support that? And then regulate the industry based on the data that exists?
Of course, we know why. It’s a rhetorical question.
But it’s an important rhetorical question.
Right wing movements are inexplicably drawn to ideology (often but not always linked to religion or some other form of sentimentalism), whether it be forms of libertarianism or socialism, or whichever other thing, and what you all need to understand is that this is all literally just bullshit designed to distract and confuse you. Ideology is a hoax and identifying with an ideology makes you a buffoon and a fool to anyone who understands that ideology is a hoax.
What we should be promoting and what we should be demanding is a society based on science and data, which works for the general wellbeing of the people. Yes, people have in times past referred to this as “national socialism,” but unfortunately, that term now has much too much baggage and is associated not only with negativity but also weird, stupid ideologies that have been built up around it (and which were even being built up around it during the 1930s).
So let’s just say “let’s look at the data.”

How are the Swiss "not known for being kooks"? There are gullible people everywhere, rich and poor. Not that I'm super pro-5G, but this idea that all Swiss people are super smart and immune to falling for fake news is funny.
I looked at the data... data says it's safe.
Please link this data. I want research showing that long term exposure is not harmful to health

As part of the nervous system, the brain is effectively an electromagnetic organ.
Shouldn't that be "an electro-chemical organ"? Or course that would mean the brain isn't directly susceptible to EM fields, beyond the "microwaving" (i.e. heating) type.
No group is immune to magical thinking.
I completely agree with you. The facts are we don’t have any definitive answers to whether 5G will negatively impact our health. That means no one can confidently say it is safe. No one. So to roll it out anyway without being aware of long term impacts is absolutely crazy to me. We are experimenting on ourselves, and if it does turn out to be damaging to our health, it’s too late by then. 5G is all about greed, and unfortunately money comes before everything else...

Oh outside of American right wingers? You must be a smart progressive we should listen to.
Here is some data you might be interested in. ;)
You're really going to argue with someone who leads their information by saying there's no way 90 Swiss people could have a weird belief.
Very silly, but also conspiracy minded people should be aware of the Swiss Solar Temple suicide cult.
Smartphones are the problem. Regular cell phones were a useful upgrade to landlines. There's no going back, though. Without wifi, The Purge would be real.

Start buying chop saws people!!! gas powered with a diamond tip blade to cut through those hard steel poles.
A person once told me that 5G antenna looks like one the targets in his local shooting range.

i live in rural town and these towers are every where and they look like those mind control devices from the game red alert. its very strange. my area is starting to look like a big antenna and utility pole farm. more towers then houses. and i have version as a client and they are going every where and installing these new little antennas that fit on utility poles. so get used to being zapped in your brain all the time. PLEASE ONCE AND A WHILE GET AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC AND ELECTRICITY/COM TOWERS AND REST YOU WILL FEEL TEN TIMES BETTER.

My city isn't on there, even though we have at least 3 5G canisters...
In that case it could be the info is out-dated. Thanks.

Yeah just check local news/boards for now. They are trying to roll it out fast.

Or the extreme danger method; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIU8WZR9DNA Do NOT I repeat DO NOT try this at home.

Don’t worry, when the electricity moving through it goes through you, you won’t have to worry about 5g anymore! Lololol

thats what grounding is for. i have been electrocuted many times. im not worried.

Good luck bro. Also I’m just looking out for the randoms that obviously aren’t as smart as you.
It's gotta be pretty bad if these wallflowers are willing to stand up.
I was thinking a mass culling of the population was what they wanted in the cards for some time.
What if this was it?
With the plummeting of birthrates already somewhat attributed to our lifestyle and cell phone use in the west, I'm seeing the possiblilty of a full on, "children of men" scenario playing out with 5g being implemented.


Honestly that was the last decent movie holly wood put out. Millions of us have been turning the spotlight on wireless radiation. Mainstream is finally taking note and things are starting to happen. Check out the class action lawsuit against samsung and apple - if you have one of these phones make sure you are watching this case. https://np.reddit.com/user/oldgamewizard/comments/c0sidt/wireless_radiation_health_effects_a_collection_of/f0ut7jk/
They're not worried about the time machine in their back yard?

4G only!!!!!!
Why a popular initiative for mobile phone liability?
Because the federal government does not protect
The federal government can have no interest in protecting the population from damage to health caused by mobile communications, as it owns 51% of SWISSCOM shares. 1
Thus the economic interests prevail. So far he has announced 2 that the operator of a mobile radio system is not liable if the mobile radio system is operated lawfully in accordance with the applicable regulations (limit values).

Because limit values ​​do not protect
Limit values ​​protect the population exclusively from heat from cellular communications
within 30 minutes. Long-term effects over 30 minutes and all biological effects, including cancer, are not taken into account. Just as the harmfulness of radioactive radiation cannot be measured and determined with a thermometer, neither can the harmfulness of cell phone radiation.

Because
the polluter pays principle should also
apply to damage caused by cell phone radiation .
By “reversing the burden of proof”, the operator of a transmitter must pay for any personal injury and damage to property in the area around the transmitter.



Because the new generation of 5G mobile communications means a
massive increase in transmission systems and
radiation exposure.More
than 180 doctors and scientists from 35 countries have signed a petition calling for the expansion of 5G technology to be halted as long as the possible
health risks have not been clarified. 3

Because cell phone damage is known,
biological effects from cell phone radiation - such as headaches, sleep disorders, exhaustion - can be proven. For example, the red blood cells clump together after a three-minute mobile phone call. Numerous studies prove health problems in humans and animals, e.g. after only one 2G antenna has been put into operation on a farm 4 . Antenna gone - calves healthy again! Plants are impaired in growth with "normal" cell phone radiation, which anyone can test with, for example, cress.

Because nobody can be against it

Even those who claim that damage from cell phone radiation has not been proven can sign here. Because there is only liability for real damage.

This is phase 1 of first lawsuit. We are open for support at a global level. We have a network of thousands around the world and tens of thousands in China, who are witnesses and have been harmed in China from the defendants technology and data transfer.The following are Federal Case Compliant Summary Facts Extracted from the official document filed in San Diego, California. To find out details of financial, personal and corrective behavioral demands, you may access the case in the federal court data base.
Dozens of cities in the US have filed lawsuits against the FCC  because of bully tactics by the FCC. The FCC is stripping away local authority with industry friendly regulations for 5G small cells. 
Oral arguments on two consolidated lawsuits against the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regarding 5G small cell densification were heard February 10 in Pasadena California. Cities are opposed to FCC orders facilitating 5G technology which the cities say constitutes a “federal overreach” and “land grab” by the telecommunications companies.
 The cases focuses on 2018 FCC rules that  specify price limits, time tables and other details which cities and companies must follow regarding the installation of wireless equipment on city streetlights, poles and rooftops.  Cities say said the FCC rule eliminates their power to negotiate  agreements on wireless antenna facilities and would force municipalities to lease public infrastructure at below-market rates, basically subsidizing access to telecommunications companies.

History and 5G
Spanish flu pandemic in 1918, which actually began in the United States, at the Naval Radio School of Cambridge, Massachusetts, with 400 initial cases. This epidemic rapidly spread to 1,127 soldiers at Funston Camp (Kansas), where wireless connections had been installed. What intrigued the doctors was that while 15% of the civilian population were suffering from nosebleeds, 40% of the Navy suffered from them. Other bleeding also occurred, and a third of those who died did so due to internal hemorrhaging of the lungs or brain. In fact, it was the composition of the blood that had been altered, as the measured coagulation time was more than twice as long as normal. These symptoms are incompatible with the effects of the influenza respiratory viruses,but totally consistent with the devastating effects of electricity. Another incongruity was that two-thirds of the victims were healthy young people. A further atypical flu symptom was that the pulse slowed to rates of between 36 and 48, whereas this is a common result of exposure to electromagnetic fields. In addition, it was possible to successfully treat some sufferers with massive doses of calcium.The military physician Dr George A. Soper testified that the virus was spreading faster than the speed of movement of people. Various experiments were conducted attempting to infect subjects either by direct close contact or by inoculation with mucus or blood –but the experimenters were unable to demonstrate any infection by this means.It can be seen that each new influenza pandemic corresponds to a new advance in electrical technology, such as the Asian flu of 1957-58, following the installation of a powerful radar surveillance system, and the outbreak of Hong Kong flu from July 1968 on wards, following the commissioning of 28 military satellites for space surveillance at the altitude of the Van Allen belts, which protect us from cosmic radiation.
Over the coming few years, a new set of infrastructure will be rolled out across the world: 5G wireless technology. Just as 4G networks are able to provide mobile internet speeds hundreds of times faster than 3G — enabling users worldwide to stream HD TV, browse webpages quickly, and even make high-quality video calls — the advent of 5G will enable speeds of up to 100 Gigabits per second: up to 100 times faster than 4G.

With each new generation of WiFi that comes out, a new wave of fear-mongering health claims emerges. They always come along with the same arguments:

humans have never been exposed to this much of this type of radiation before,
scientists have not demonstrated that the proposed new infrastructure won't be harmful to humans,
the World Health Organization has already declared radio-frequency (WiFi) radiation to be "possibly cancerous,"
and therefore, we should declare a moratorium on this technology until its safety has been established.
Fortunately, science already tells us that 5G almost certainly poses no danger to humans. Unless you value unfounded conspiracies over bona fide science, here's what you should know.

You have to go to higher energies, and shorter wavelengths, to probe the smallest scales.

Above, you can see the electromagnetic spectrum. While you're typically only aware of your interactions with optical (visible) and infrared (heat) radiation, there's much more that's constantly interacting with your body. There are lower-energy signals such as microwaves, with wavelength between a millimeter and a meter, bombard us constantly here on Earth. Microwave radiation includes a mix of natural signals like atmospheric molecules, astronomical signals, and even the leftover glow from the Big Bang, coupled with human-made radio, radar, satellite, bluetooth, GPS and broadband signals. It also includes all WiFi signals, including 3G, 4G and 5G.

Also invisible to human eyes are higher-energy signals: ultraviolet, X-ray, and gamma-ray light. In large doses, any form of radiation can be dangerous to living things, but in modest doses, only the high-energy signals matter.

The reason for this, believe it or not, has everything to do with the quantum nature of matter and energy. When light interacts with matter, there are three possibilities for what can occur:

The light is of the wrong wavelength to be absorbed by the matter, and therefore gets reflected.
The light is of the right wavelength to be absorbed by matter but too low in energy to kick any electrons off of their parent atoms/molecules.
Light gets absorbed and each photon is energetic enough to ionize one (or more) electrons.
Plants are green, for example, because they don't absorb green light; instead they reflect it. Food gets cooked in a microwave because liquid water molecules (along with some others) are excellent absorbers of microwave radiation, enabling it to heat up. (Fun fact: ice, which is a lattice of water molecules, isn't a good absorber of microwave radiation, which is why your frozen foods can be simultanously boiling on the outside, where the ice has melted, but remain frozen at the center.)

But the third option, where ionization occurs and electrons get kicked off of atoms, is the type of radiation that truly is damaging at the cellular level to biological organisms. This is why you wear sunscreen when you know your skin is going to be exposed to direct sunlight: because the ultraviolet light will ionize the material in your skin and cause burns that can get quite severe.

That's why you wear a lead shield when you get an X-ray taken, because that even higher-energy radiation can cause extensive damage to your body. And that's why you demand excessive shielding for any nuclear reactors and require humans to stay far away from any nuclear detonations: because gamma-rays, the highest-energy radiation of all, can cause cellular damage so severe it can be fatal to humans in even small, targeted doses.

Cosmic rays produced by high-energy astrophysics sources can reach any object in the Solar System,... [+] and appear to permeate our local region of space omnidirectionally. When they collide with Earth, they strike atoms in the atmosphere, creating particle and radiation showers at the surface. The small amount of ionizing radiation that reaches the surface in the form of ultraviolet, X-ray, and gamma-ray radiation is far and away the most dangerous type to living organisms.
Cosmic rays produced by high-energy astrophysics sources can reach any object in the Solar System,... [+] ASPERA COLLABORATION / ASTROPARTICLE ERANET
The ionizing radiation is what causes the most direct, severe damage to not only human but most living things, and that's why there are such tight regulations, all over the world, on how much of these hazardous types of radiation any entity can emit.

But non-ionizing radiation that gets absorbed can still cause damage, provided that there's enough total energy to be damaging. Instead of ionizing individual electrons, this radiation can get absorbed and converted into thermal (heat) energy, and too much heat — just as it can cook plants, animals or fungi — can permanently damage living tissue.

So it seems like a legitimate question: could 5G wireless technology, and the ambient radiation that it will create surrounding each and every one of us, possibly be damaging?

If you ask a WiFi truther, like Berkeley's Joel Moskowitz, they'll insist that it is. That WiFi has already been harming us, that it's the cause of a number of rampant health problems in the human population, that there's an enormous conspiracy to bury it, and that since the World Health Organization has classified 5G (and WiFi radiation in general) as possibly carcinogenic, we should avoid it until it's demonstrated that it's safe, after all.

Unfortunately for Moskowitz, and fortunately for society, possibly carcinogenic is one of the lowest danger levels that can be ascribed to a risk factor. If any study at all finds that any dose of a substance causes any spike in cancer in any creature — even in mice, even with a small sample size, even with marginal or dubious significance — this is the classification it gets. If you're not afraid of coffee or thyme, or getting a nickel with your change, you shouldn't be afraid of 5G, or WiFi radiation in general.

Hundreds of materials, chemicals, and other forms of matter and energy have been classified as... [+] 'possibly carcinogenic' by the World Health Organization, including nickel, like the kind found in all American nickels from the 1800s onwards. Unless something gets reclassified as either carcinogenic or probably carcinogenic, there's no need to fear it.

The reason for this is simple: the only way this radiation can harm you is through the total energy your body (or a part of your body) absorbs. Whenever a device sends or receives a wireless signal, it emits or searches for radiation of the appropriate frequency. The devices all use power, and the energy they emit spreads out in a sphere: falling off as the inverse of the distance squared as you leave the source.

If you ever held a portable radio or boombox close to you, you received far more radiation of similar frequencies than you do from a 5G device that sits in your pocket. At the end-user, consumer level, even dozens of devices surrounding you — similar to the situation you'd experience in an office, classroom, or airport — impart a level of radiation that, based on energy concerns, ought to pose no threat at all.

As Dr. Alex Berezow of the American Council on Science and Health states, the assumption that 5G is safe is already backed by the full suite of scientific studies. Only, he contends, "[i]f sufficient evidence shows something to the contrary, then we should reconsider the status quo."

From a theoretical point of view, there's absolutely no reason to fear 5G technology, or WiFi radiation in any form.

But if you were really curious about the potential hazards to humans, you'd take a look at the people who get the highest levels of 5G radiation exposure: the electrical and construction workers who build and install the wireless communication towers that provide the necessary infrastructure for 5G. In the UK, the National Register of RF workers is the body that looks after the health and safety of that group of people, and it's composed entirely of RF workers themselves.

What might be a dangerous dose of radiation when you're four inches (about 10 centimeters) away from it goes down by a factor of 10,000 when you move to be about 33 feet (10 meters) from it.

As reported by Simon Rockman here on Forbes, there are 4,500 people in the UK who work in close proximity to radiofrequency (RF) radiation. The RF exposure they're allowed to receive is five times that of the general population, and there is no evidence that they have higher rates of cancer or any other health problems that could possibly be attributable to WiFi radiation than any other population of humans.

Still, the best measure that they can take is to simply have a small exclusion zone around the radio masts (or towers) that emit the most powerful signals for this type of radiation. So long as that exclusion zone is about 10 meters in all directions, any humans outside of the zone will undoubtedly be safe. A receiver/transmitter that's perched very high above the ground or a tall building will automatically be safe for any humans directly beneath it, so long as they're more than 10 meters below the active device.

Finally, the benefits that 5G will bring to society in the coming decade are truly revolutionary. In addition to the accelerated speeds that regular consumers will see, laying the infrastructure for 5G will enable civilization-changing smart technologies and a virtually unlimited number of device connections. 5G will enable blossoming technologies that rely on connectivity to the internet to go widespread, from connected self-driving cars to smart plugs, lights, cameras, toothbrushes, thermostats, healthcare monitoring devices and more. The Internet of Things is coming, and 5G is the technology that will take it mainstream.

There are lots of real hazards out there in the world, but 5G — much like vaccines, fluoridated drinking water, and the vapor trails left by airplanes — aren't among them. In the search for truth, society should rely on the full suite of scientific evidence, rather than fear or ideology, to guide us. When we do, all of us can reap the benefits of a safe, connected world.

Previous post:5G – 60GHz Wireless Network – Oxygen Absorption – Unable to Breath
5G has galvanised grassroots communities in Australia and globally into action, with a momentum that is truly astounding. There are literally tens of thousands of YOU around Australia, that do not consent to the 24/7 onslaught of radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation (RF EMR) that 5G will bring in to our communities. At the time of compiling this Strategy Kit, while people in many countries around the world are in the throes of a Covid-19 lockdown, the 5G roll-out has been accelerated. Despite a huge body of independent scientific evidence showing the negative effects of RF EMR, those in power have chosen to ignore, deny or even destroy these inconvenient truths until NOW! The simple fact remains that health is a fundamental human right. We, our children, animals and plants need to be adequately protected. Commercial interests can no longer be prioritised. Industry and governments must be held accountable, or the damage for all of us will be catastrophic and irreversible. So, as we face the might of a trillion-dollar industry, the question remains: what can we do? You're reading this Strategy Kit because you – and the community you represent – have chosen to ACT. Contrary to what we might be told, we are powerful. There are many examples of communities around the world, who have succeeded in putting the brakes on 5G and that list is growing. We've put this kit together because Stop 5G groups around Australia have asked us to share our strategies, resources and insights. Like all of you, we have no certainty what results our ongoing campaign will bring, but we'll certainly keep going. The list of templates, samples and resources you'll find here is a collective effort, compiled with the help of the Northern Rivers crew predominantly. It’s with great respect and a SPECIAL THANK YOU to the many groups and individuals who contributed to this kit: ECSFR, Australasian Society of Building Biologists, NO5G Australia, WeAreNotSAM, Stop 5G Tweed Shire, Stop5G Australia, We Say NO To 5G in Australia and Dr Murray May for the specific content and collaboration. To the wider Stop 5G Movement and groups around Australia THANK YOU for the endless inspiration and support. How do you use this kit? Please diligently cut and paste information to a new WORD document and ensure you update YOUR Council’s name correctly. Any footnotes will paste over automatically. This pack is addressing the Byron Shire Council and will need to be updated in many places in the templates. You need to be clear and accurate about what you and your community are objecting to: is it a proposal to build a new mobile phone base station, upgrade an existing base station to 5G or install a small cell on a utility pole or building? No matter where you are in your journey of 5G and the complexity of what it entails, you are embarking on and undertaking very important work for humanity and our planet! Volunteering to help stop the 5G roll-out is not an easy task. You will need to become very informed on many confronting issues, your habits and way of life will come under question and many relationships will be forever impacted by you standing up and using your voice. There is no better time to dive on in, as silence is most definitely regarded as consent. Power is with the People, The Stop 5G Northern Rivers NSW - Core Group


PETITION LETTER AGAINST PROPOSED 5G UPGRADE TO: 

1. The 5G roll out is a breach of the mandatory obligation to apply the precautionary principle when deploying mobile phone radiocommunications infrastructure (Clause 4 Mobile Phone Base Station Deployment Code). 2. There are thousands of peer-reviewed scientific studies evidencing harm from radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation (RF EMR) well below the standards set by ARPANSA. 3. The ARPANSA Standard has been strongly criticised by independent scientists worldwide as unscientific and inadequate for the protection of human safety. Authorities in other countries have adopted standards ten to 100 times more rigorous than the ARPANSA Standard. 4. More than 250 scientists have signed the International EMF Scientist Appeal, which calls for stronger exposure limits. These scientists have published more than 2000 peer-reviewed papers on EMF in professional journals and arguably constitute the majority of experts on the effects of non-ionizing radiation. 5. No long-term prospective studies have been completed proving the safety of RF EMR levels under the ARPANSA Standard for children. 6. In 2011, the International Agency on Research on Cancer (IARC) listed non-ionising radiofrequency radiation from cell phones and other wireless devices in Group 2B: Possibly carcinogenic to humans. 7. A number of leading scientists have since argued that the evidence that wireless is carcinogenic has increased and IARC should upgrade the listing to Group 2A: probably carcinogenic to humans or Group 1: carcinogenic to humans classification. 8. The views of ICNIRP (on whose guidelines the ARPANSA safety limit is based) and ARPANSA are not in line with the opinions of the larger, independent scientific community that has published peer-reviewed research on the biological effects of RF EMR. ICNIRP is not independent of industry and has had numerous conflicts of interest identified over the years. 9. 5G would massively increase our exposure to RF EMR with a new array of densely populated “small” cell transmitters making this hazardous exposure inescapable 24/7. 10. There are no independent long-term studies demonstrating the safety of prolonged exposure to the millimetre frequencies (from 26 GHz up to 86+ GHz) intended to be used for 5G in the future. 11. Scientific literature on the health risks of 5G frequencies identifies detrimental skin and ocular effects and profound effects on all biological systems including cells, bacteria, yeast, animals and humans, including heart rate variability, teratogenicity, bacterial growth alterations with antibiotic resistance. 12. Internationally, hundreds of scientists and medical doctors have called for a moratorium on the roll-out of 5G until potential hazards for human health and the environment have been fully evaluated (e.g. International EMF Scientist Appeal and the 5G Appeal). Such moratoria have been implemented overseas (e.g. in Brussels, Geneva and Glastonbury). 17 13. ARPANSA has acknowledged that further research on the frequencies to be used with 5G is needed: Both the RSC (2014) and SCENIHR (2015) reviews identified that the dosimetry in the 6 GHz to 300 GHz range is still developing and further research is required to examine the effects of exposure to new and emerging technologies. The SCENIHR review in particular mentioned that “considering the expected increase in use of THz technologies, more research focusing on the effects on skin (long-term, low-level exposure) and cornea (high intensity, short-term exposure) is recommended. 14. 5G millimetre waves involve vastly more pulsation than the 3G and 4G microwaves. There is substantial scientific evidence that pulsed EMFs are usually much more biologically active than non-pulsed (or continuous wave) EMFs. 15. Upgrading the base station to 5G would add a layer of radiation exposure, on top of the already existing 3G and 4G infrastructure. EME levels would continue to rise cumulatively as further carriers upgrade to 5G by installing more antennas. They would rise even further in the second phase of 5G with the use of mmWaves requiring the dense deployment of small cells. 16. Multiple peer-reviewed studies have shown an increase in ill health effects in populations living near mobile phone base stations, ranging from neurological damage to breast and brain cancers. 17. A recent analysis by Vertiv found that the move to 5G would likely increase total network energy consumption by 150 to 170 per cent by 2026, with extreme impacts for global warming. 18. Professor Martin Pall (Emeritus of Biochemistry and Basic Medical Sciences, Washington State University) has warned that EMF exposures make plants much more flammable, and may therefore cause and contribute to bushfires. With Australia facing record bush fire threat levels, there is an urgent need for more research into the bushfire risk 5G poses to rural (and even urban) Australia. 19. Many scientists have warned that flora and fauna – trees, birds, wildlife and insects are all under threat of harm (or worse) from microwave radiation from 5G. Widespread harm to flora and fauna (especially bees) would have dire repercussions for us all. 20. There are growing privacy and security concerns about the Internet of Things, with increasing invasions of smart home devices by hackers. 21. Mobile phone towers, in general, cause a significant loss of scenic amenity to residents. 22. Based upon historical trends, mobile phone towers adversely affect the value and saleability of nearby properties. 23. Wired communications are more resilient to storm, flood, fire and more energy efficient than wireless networks. 24. Cumulative, simultaneous exposure of people to RF EMR from all sources (i.e. towers, small cells, WiFi, Smart City infrastructure, smart street lighting and IoT devices) is not regulated.

Submission: Proposed 5G upgrade to tower at 95 Dalley Street, Mullumbimby 2482 For the reasons outlined below, we object to the above mentioned proposed upgrade. 1. Petitions We have sent (to Wireless Consultant/Telstra) petitions signed by 268 residents of the Northern Rivers region or visitors. Included are 155 members of the Mullumbimby community (within a 10k radius), including 48 residents within a 400m radius of the tower and local business owners and employees. An online petition3 advocating for a “Byron Shire to Stay Free From 5G” is circulating and gathering more support every day. As of 17 March 2020, there are 1,341 signatories. These petitions are a snap shot of the community’s views. We are a volunteer group with limited resources and time, doing our best to give the community a voice on this issue. It is Telstra’s responsibility to capture market research, instead of pushing unwanted technology on whole communities. As the public notification process for this upgrade consisted of a single classified notice in the Byron News (not the local Mullumbimby paper, which is the Echo) we believe a large part of the Mullumbimby community is unaware of the proposed upgrade. If all interested and affected parties had actually been notified, you would have received many more objections to the proposed upgrade. Given the short consultation period we were not able to distribute the petition throughout the entire community. However, of the community members who were given access to the petition, 99% signed it! We believe that this sample reflects the position of the community as a whole. A recent survey was conducted of businesses within a 300m radius from the 95 Dalley St tower. These local businesses were asked if they wanted a 5G network in the CBD area of Mullumbimby. Of the businesses surveyed 100% of them opposed the 5G upgrade and signed petitions. 2. Location Sensitive Proposed site upgrade distance from sensitive and essential service locations in the community: Meadows Medical Clinic 90m, Police Station 150m, Fire and Rescue station 170m, Mullumbimby Comprehensive Health Clinic 220m, Mullumbimby Neighbourhood Community Centre 260m, Council Chambers 300m, Cobbers Childcare Centre 330m. It is important to consider the Fire and Rescue station that is only 170m away from the site; it has been well documented that increasing exposure to mobile phone towers can have adverse biological effects on humans, and these risks can have far greater impacts to the community when it affects our protectors. “Firefighters are the protectors of people and property and should be protected under the Precautionary Principle of Science and therefore, unless radiation is proven safe and harmless, cellular antennas should not be placed on or near fire stations.”4 Scientific studies have shown that radio frequency electromagnetic radiation (RF EMR) can cause immune dysfunction and short term-exposures to millimetre waves can have adverse physiological effects on the peripheral nervous system, the immune system and the cardiovascular system. With vulnerable members of the community needing access to medical centres, it would be dangerous and irresponsible of Telstra to intentionally increase the public’s exposure to RF EMR in such close proximity to these essential services. Causing further biological oxidative stress on humans by an involuntary exposure to radiation is both reckless and unnecessary.

On the 13th of June 2019, over 300 local residents participated in a rally outside the Byron Shire Council (BSC) calling for a moratorium on the 5G roll out.6 The Byron Shire Mayor, Simon Richardson, responded to the community concerns by addressing the BSC (located in Mullumbimby) with a Mayoral Minute.7 Mayor Richardson proposed to, “Include within its list of invited speakers, representatives from Telstra, ARPANSA, the Member for Richmond, Justine Elliot MP, any pertinent accredited experts in this field and representatives from the Stop 5G Northern Rivers group.” We were informed by the Mayor, that Telstra and ARPANSA declined Council’s initial invitation to engage in a community information session. The community have been waiting for over 6 months to participate with an informed panel regarding the 5G roll out. Ten months later it is safe to say that the community awareness and objection to 5G has grown exponentially in Mullumbimby. There are available alternatives to 5G that will adequately meet the telecommunications service needs of the community without producing emissions that pose a serious threat to human health and that of the natural ecosystems we depend upon. Mullumbimby is a community that strongly advocates to remain Free From 5G. We ask that Telstra focus on the delivery of wired infrastructure to homes and businesses, with wireless services as an adjunct ONLY where necessary. 4. De-tox Tourism and White Zones The Byron Shire is a leading national tourist destination for Australians and International visitors alike. Tourists flock to this area to “chill out and slow down”; but with 5G people would literally heat up (the skin) and speed up (online connectivity). Mullumbimby sits in the heart of the Northern Rivers region and health, natural beauty, environmental protection and community connection are upheld as key values. Many of the visitors to this region come from the city and welcome a de-tox from the highly addictive technologies (such as smart phones and lap-tops), whilst they engage with the natural environment and many experiences on offer (yoga, meditation, retreat, permaculture, hobby farming etc). Communities close to Mullumbimby that fall within mobile phone ‘black spots’ are becoming more prized and needed as valuable White Zones (environment’s free from harmful microwave radiation rays and WiFi free). White Zones (otherwise known as Black Spots) can be preserved as sanctuaries for life, and as such can enjoy economic benefits. EMR is a pollutant and likely carcinogen. Several White Zone areas can be found in the surrounds of Mullumbimby and if 5G is implemented in to the centre of this thriving small town, it will be a major deterrent not just to residents but also to health-conscious visitors and electro hypersensitive individuals. This will be to the detriment of the local economy. The Wilson's Creek community (only 10km from Mullumbimby and in a White Zone) successfully halted a proposed 4G Telstra tower in 2018 and has comprehensively documented and proven the strong community objection to new mobile phone towers and 5G upgrades in the Mullumbimby township and surrounds. Many public meetings have been held in Mullumbimby as far back as the 4th of August 2018.8 Please note, all of these Wilson’s Creek residents rely on Mullumbimby for essential services and access to basic goods; 5G will be a major deterrent and potential health risk to these community members. 5. There are no proven 5G use cases that would benefit the community The ITC industry claims that 5G will bring all kinds of benefits to the community. However, on close examination, this is mostly speculation, and 5G offers little beyond what wired, 4G and WiFi services can provide. For example, remote surgery using 5G, whilst technologically possible, is completely impractical. Frost & Sullivan analyst Michael Jude has pointed out that health care organisations would be "crazy" to try remote surgery over a wireless network. Connection reliability would require antennas to be built on “practically everything”, and even then “it would be really hard to do with any kind of acceptable reality”9 . Although the telecommunications industry has been vigorously promoting the application of 5G in the deployment of connected and automated vehicles, 5G is not actually needed for driverless vehicles and automotive makers are not basing their plans for vehicle autonomy on the availability of 5G coverage.10 Moreover, for an autonomous vehicle road network that relies on 5G, there could not be any trees over 4 metres high by the roadside as these would interfere with wireless signals necessary to run the network.

11 Public meeting, Connected Hobart Public Forum: Help build Hobart’s Future, Presentation by Will Oakley (RACT)-autonomous vehicles, 26 21 use 5G, a very large part of road infrastructure would need to be covered by 5G. A 5G antenna would be required every 200 metres along Australian roads (and every 50 to 100m in urban areas), introducing a whole new level of road safety risks. It is a serious concern that the telecommunications industry claims of “smart” roads and 5G cars improving road safety are unfounded. The opposite may well prove to be the case. For example, in Britain, since the introduction of “smart motorways,” the number of fatal accidents, and the number of near misses has risen significantly.12 Other hypothetical 5G use cases (such as automation in transport, manufacturing, retail and customer service) if they were to materialise could cause widespread job losses. Despite this risk, neither government nor industry has conducted a cost-benefit analysis of the impact this would have on the local economy and community. 6. Increased RF EMR emissions and the use of millimetre waves would put flora and fauna at risk A large number of studies have shown that electromagnetic radiation poses a risk to bird and insect navigation systems (reducing their resistance to disease) and plant health.13 Studies have also shown that insects are especially susceptible to millimetre wave frequencies and eminent scientists have predicted 5G will exacerbate Bee Colony Collapse Disorder. It has been demonstrated that the radiation levels emitted by 5G networks will heat bodies of insects to the levels that will affect their normal physiology.14 Insects are not only important pollinators, they are the base of the food chain for birds, amphibians, reptiles and mammals. We bring Telstra’s attention to a report15 prepared by Australian botanist Mark Broomhall to UNESCO that details the association between increasing amounts of electromagnetic radiation and species disappearance and exodus from the Mt. Nardi area of the Nightcap National Park World Heritage Area over a 15-year period. The report contains a timeline of the activation of new antennas and documents the birds, bats and flying insects that have decreased in the area. We believe that the roll-out of 5G in Mullumbimby and the Northern Rivers would jeopardise the survival of threatened and endangered species in the area (including native bees and a healthy honey bee population). A decline of bees in the local area could also have a damaging impact on the agricultural sector in the Northern Rivers region and negatively impact the local honey industry. The weekly Mullumbimby Farmers Market is a vital part of the community’s fabric, where local farmers make their livelihood and the community directly support their businesses. A decline in bees would have devastating impact on the whole community. The Stop 5G Northern Rivers NSW group have set-up stalls at the local Farmer’s Market and have been overwhelmed by the community rejection of any 5G upgrades or additional 5G infrastructure in Mullumbimby and the Northern Rivers region. 7. The proposed upgrade is part of Telstra’s 5G roll out, which contravenes the requirement in the Mobile Base Station Deployment Code (“the Code”) that it take a precautionary approach to deployment. The limits in the Radiation Protection Standard (RPS3) are not precautionary as: (i) ARPANSA does not apply the precautionary principle when setting the limits. (ii) The limits are designed to protect against short-term, thermal levels of RF EMR exposure only, and do not protect against non-thermal effects of low-level exposure. (iii) When setting the limits in the Radiation Protection Standard (RPS3), ARPANSA disregards thousands of peerreviewed scientific studies showing adverse biological effects on humans at non-thermal levels, below the limits in the ARPANSA Standard. (iv) Hundreds of independent experts on RF EMR effects attest that exposures below the limits in RPS3 can be harmful to human health. For example, more than 250 scientists from 43 countries have signed the International EMF Scientist Appeal, which calls for stronger exposure limits.


International EMF Scientist Appeal https://emfscientist.org/ 22 (v) The limits in RPS3 are not protective of vulnerable groups such as pregnant women and children who are more sensitive to the effects of RF EMR. Despite the recommendation of ICNIRP that separate guidelines be developed (or the ICNIRP guidelines be adjusted) for these sensitive groups17, ARPANSA adopted the guidelines without doing so. (vi) Although the limits in RPS3 include a “safety margin,” this is only designed to protect against thermal effects and is not at all precautionary. As the limits in RPS3 are not based on the precautionary principle, Telstra’s adherence to those limits does not amount to compliance with the Code requirement that Telstra take a precautionary approach to deployment. 5G poses a potentially catastrophic and irreversible risk of harm to human health as: (i) The deployment of 5G will result in an exponential increase in base stations and other RF EMR devices, dramatically increasing the public’s cumulative RF EMR exposure. (ii) Internationally, thousands of scientists, medical doctors and health care providers have called for a moratorium on the roll-out of 5G until potential hazards for human health and the environment have been fully evaluated.18 (vii) In 2017, the 250+ experts in the International EMF Scientist Appeal issued a statement recommending that 5G technologies must be subjected to an independent health and safety assessment before they are launched. (viii) From 2021, 5G will use millimetre waves and phased array antenna beamforming that have not been rigorously tested for safety. (ix) 5G has unpredictable propagation patterns that could result in unacceptable levels of human exposure to electromagnetic radiation. 19 (x) 5G millimetre waves involve vastly more pulsation than the 3G and 4G microwaves and there is substantial scientific evidence that pulsed EMFs are usually much more biologically active than are non-pulsed (or continuous wave) EMFs.20 (xi) The very limited existing scientific research on the health risks of 5G frequencies identifies potential detrimental skin and ocular effects and profound effects on all biological systems including cells, bacteria, yeast, animals and humans, including heart rate variability, teratogenicity, bacterial growth alterations with antibiotic resistance.21 (xii) There is evidence millimetre waves will have adverse effects on the skin and eyes, such as skin cancer and cataracts. (xiii) Preliminary evidence shows that exposure to frequencies over 30GHz could alter gene expression, increase the temperature of the skin, stimulate cell proliferation, alter the functions of cell membrane and neuro-muscular systems, and are able to modulate the synthesis of proteins involved in inflammatory and immunologic process, with possible systemic effects.22 (xiv) There is evidence that biological responses to millimetre-wave irradiation can be initiated within the skin, and the subsequent systemic signalling in the skin can result in physiological effects on the nervous system, heart and immune system.23 (xv) Telecommunications industry assurances that 5G will maintain “low levels” of RF EMR exposure are meaningless as the assumption that low level exposure will never cause health effects is scientifically unsupported.24 (xvi) Prof. Martin Pall identifies evidence of the cumulative nature and eventual irreversibility of neurological/neuropsychiatric, reproductive, mutational DNA, cardiac effects and some hormonal effects, which he describes as potentially existential threats. He warns that 5G poses a risk of a drastic rise in multiple diseases and ailments, a catastrophic irreversible decline in reproduction and possible epidemics of melanoma, blindness, renal failure, autoimmune disease, spontaneous abortion and autism as a consequence of 5G.

People’s cumulative, simultaneous exposures from all RF EMR sources (such as towers, small cells, WiFi, smart city infrastructure, smart street lighting, smart metres, mobile phones and other wireless smart devices) are currently unregulated and unmonitored. (xix) In some areas, the larger 5G exclusion zones (where RF EMR is greater than 100% of the public exposure limit) could extend into neighbouring properties where people live and work. We are opposed to the raising of the (already too high) limits in RPS3 to accommodate 5G. No reasonable person could conclude that deployment of 5G in the absence of adequate safety testing is a precautionary approach. 8. The opinions of ICNIRP, ARPANSA, the WHO and the CMO out of line with the majority of experts We do not consider it reasonable to rely on the opinions of ICNIRP, ARPANSA, the WHO and Chief Medical Officer, Brendan Murphy, as they form the minority opinion. Independent experts have pointed out that ICNIRP’s denial of the existence of adverse effects of RF EMR below the ICNIRP Guidelines is not supported by the scientific evidence as ICNIRP ignores significant peer-reviewed studies that have found health effects below the Guidelines.26 The same criticisms have been made of the ARPANSA Standard.27 Furthermore, although ICNIRP holds itself out to be independent from commercial, national and vested interests, it is alleged to have conflicts of interest such as industry ties and industry funding28 and has been described as “a public relations organization of the mobile communications industry”.29 As part of a project called “The 5G Mass Experiment,” Investigate Europe (a team of investigative journalists from the European Union) allege the existence of an “ICNIRP cartel”, a group of scientists who have either helped create, or defend the ICNIRP Guidelines. The journalists argue that the cartel preserves the current ICNIRP Guidelines for industry by conducting biased reviews of the scientific literature that minimize the health risks of RF EMR exposure.30 9. 5G would consume significant amounts of energy and threaten the achievement of national and global climate goals. The wireless approach presents a far bigger carbon footprint than wired communications. As the amount of required base stations, smart infrastructure and wireless devices exponentially increases, so too does total network energy consumption. 26 Starkey, S. J.,  

A recent study conducted by Vertiv and 451 Research found that 5G is going to be significantly more energy-intensive than previous generations of wireless connectivity and more than 90 per cent of telecommunications operators fear the roll-out of 5G technologies will result in significantly higher energy costs. Vertiv’s own internal analysis discovered that the move to 5G is likely to increase total network energy consumption by 150 to 170 percent by 2026. An analysis33 of the ITC industry’s global electricity usage estimates that in the worst-case scenario, the sector would use as much as 51% of electricity worldwide and contribute to up to 23% of greenhouse gas emissions in 2030. The authors state that this will happen if not enough progress is made in electricity efficiency of wireless access networks and fixed access networks/data centres. The telecommunications industry has not proposed any solutions to the potentially enormous 5G carbon footprint. Its only response has been to speculate that future technological innovations and Artificial Intelligence may succeed in reducing energy consumption, an idea that is conjecture at this point in time. 
10. 5G would increase pollution and electronic waste 5G and related devices would also create a massive increase in pollution (from toxins released during mining and manufacturing of electronics) and electronic waste (from the discarding of products, due to planned and perceived obsolescence, containing toxic materials). The central business district of Mullumbimby has an immediate proximity to the 95 Dalley Street site. Telstra do not take into consideration the cumulative electro smog pollution (WiFi, smart devices, Bluetooth etc) when calculating predictive EME reports and public exposure.35 In the local Mullumbimby town and neighbouring Byron Bay, it has been well documented in the mainstream news that a large and vocal community do not consent to increases in RF EMR exposure from tower and base station upgrades; furthermore it has been proven by an accredited Building Biology expert36 that exposure levels are already unacceptable in some densely populated local areas. 37 The personal privacy concerns of the IoT are so great that it has been described as the “IT asbestos of the future”38. There is no plan in place to manage these risks or the mounting electronic waste as people remove “smart” devices from their homes to protect their security. 11. Wireless networks are a poor substitute for wired infrastructure Many in our community are alarmed that secure, fixed landlines are being removed and replaced with wireless antennae that are unreliable due to being subject to weather conditions, fire and fallible electricity supply, and are insecure in terms of safety and privacy. Fibre optic networks which provide faster broadband speeds, are safer, more cyber secure, and more reliable in rural areas than wireless networks. In addition, the advantages of using fixed broadband rather than wireless for moving large amounts of information will grow as data usage increases in the future.

Optical fibre is totally secure because the signal is confined within the fibre. It is far less prone to failure than wireless technology. In terms of speed, optical fibre networks can ultimately be much faster than 5G and bring speeds of 10 gb/second to homes and businesses.40 Optical fibre will be able to be upgraded to incredible speeds in the future, far more easily and economically than infrastructure intensive upgrades to wireless services. Paul Heroux Ph.D. (Professor of Electromagnetic Toxicology, Faculty of Medicine, McGill University) has explained how, “Any sophisticated society in the future will need and will depend on optical fibre.”41 Timothy Schoechle, PhD, communications technology expert, in his paper, Re-Inventing Wires: The Future of Landlines and Networks42, describes how wired infrastructure is inherently more future-proof, more reliable, more sustainable, more energy efficient, faster and safer than wireless networks which are laden with risks, technically limiting, undependable, energy intensive and relatively inefficient. He illustrates how wireless access service is not an adequate substitute for wires, and should be considered an adjunct to wired access service. He recommends that the goal should be to bring fibre as close to the user as possible, to use a copper tail for short distances where necessary, and to resort to wireless technology as a last resort. Dr Schoechle opines that telecommunications service needs can be better met by wired infrastructure and/or still-emerging 4G LTE technology, stating: “Wireless broadband access is not an adequate substitute for wired access (CTC, 2017). Millimeter wave (e.g., 5G wireless) backhaul is at best an on-the-cheap solution favored by corporations looking for short-term profits. It is wholly inadequate for a number reasons, among which is that it depends on an invasive and unstable complex millimeter wave hardware/software prone to (sometimes-planned) obsolescence. This complex approach contrasts sharply with the simplicity of basic future-proof fibre/hardwired facilities.” In the Foreword to Dr Schoechle’s report, Frank Clegg (former President, Microsoft Canada) states: “This paper sets the record straight … offering consumers, business leaders and policy makers the critical facts they need to rethink a more intelligent and secure future with reliable, secure, wired communications more resilient to storm, flood and fire, and reducing the enormous carbon foot print from the present wireless approach. It also demonstrates why the mistaken upcoming 5G frenzy, with its millions of small cell antennas, destined to clutter all neighborhoods and public right-of-ways, is dangerous, wasteful and unnecessary.” Furthermore, Mullumbimby already has the fixed line option of ADSL and the NBN network is in progress. This small town does not need 5G to secure an internet connection. Conclusion We are strongly opposed to the deployment of 5G in Mullumbimby as it is energy intensive, unreliable, insecure, wasteful, polluting, ugly, harmful to humans and the environment and unnecessary. Mullumbimby already has wired ADSL options and plans to deliver the secure fibre to the curb infrastructure; which can be utilised instead. 5G technology is being developed as it is being deployed. Its hypothetical business use cases may never evolve, and even if they do, may do more harm than good to the community. Currently, Telstra is not giving consideration to the impact of the average and peak cumulative effects of non-ionising radiation on the Mullumbimby community; a 5G upgrade would further increase residents’, workers’ and visitors’ exposures to RF EMR.43 Many residents do not consent to an increase in RF EMR (see petitions attached). The National Toxicology Study44 has affirmatively determined that there is a direct causal relationship between RF EMR and cancer. In 2011, the International Agency on Research on Cancer (IARC), listed non-ionising radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation from cell phones and other wireless devices in Group 2B: Possibly carcinogenic to humans, alongside lead, engine exhaust and 40 
Since then, leading scientists in the field have argued that the proof that wireless is carcinogenic has increased and IARC should upgrade the listing to a Group 2A: probably carcinogenic to humans or a Group 1: carcinogenic to humans classification.45 The safety of 5G millimetre waves and phased array beamforming have not been anywhere near adequately tested and independent scientists are warning of catastrophic, even existential, risks to human health and the environment. When proposing to deploy 5G in Mullumbimby, Telstra is ignoring the opinions of over 250 internationally recognised doctors and scientists, from more than 40 different countries, all of whom have documented harmful effects of RF EMR. On the risks of 5G, Professor Lennart Hardell (a world renowned oncologist from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden and Professor at Örebro University Hospital in Sweden) recently stated, “… if no action is currently taken, the costs to society will most likely be very high in terms of premature deaths, deteriorated public health and damage to the ecological system.” We refer Telstra to the legal opinion46 of Danish lawyer, Christian Jensen, regarding health impacts of 5G. It is the conclusion of this legal opinion that establishing and activating a 5G-network, as it is currently described, would be in contravention of current human and environmental laws enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, EU regulations, and the Bern- and Bonn-conventions. The reason is the very significant body of scientific documentation available, showing that radiofrequent electromagnetic radiation is harmful and dangerous to the health of humans (particularly children), animals and plants. This also applies when the radiation remains within the limits recommended by ICNIRP and currently used in Denmark as well as broadly within the EU. The ARPANSA Standard is one of the least protective standards in the world. It is based on guidelines created by a private organisation (ICNIRP) that has been alleged to have numerous commercial conflicts of interest and is not subject to independent regulatory examination. ARPANSA states that, “The exposure limits in the ARPANSA Standard are only enforceable if they are referenced in other regulatory arrangements.” The forward to RPS3 makes it clear that the onus is on industry to identify and manage risks from radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation (RF EMR). We do not believe that Telstra is taking adequate precautions to limit the exposure of residents in Mullumbimby to RF EMR. It appears to us that Telstra sees the ridiculously high limits in RPS3 as a licence to ignore the large body of scientific evidence, and the opinions of the majority of experts, that exposures below those limits are unsafe. Telstra has no such licence. We ask Telstra to apply the precautionary principle, as required by the Deployment Code, and halt its proposed deployment of 5G in Mullumbimby. If Telstra decides to continue with deployment of 5G in Mullumbimby, despite the community’s objections, we request Telstra publish a written undertaking, addressed to the entire Mullumbimby population (existing and future), to compensate anyone who suffers loss or damage as a result. 


Dear Council of XXXX, I write in relation to the planned implementation of the 5G cell rollout in our council area in general and near my (residential property/office/premise), in particular. I am aware that wireless radiofrequency (RF) exposure has been linked to immediate and chronic illnesses including cancer, heart disease, infertility and neurological and genetic defects amongst many others.i This is substantiated in over 10,000 peerreviewed scientific papers,ii including by the World Health Organisation, which classifies RF radiation as possibly carcinogenic (cancer-causing).iii Therefore it is the current rollout of the 5G infrastructure, including new towers/tower upgrades as well as new 4GX/5G small cells/antenna or antenna and cells that will be used for the 5G roll out, which is of great concern to me, due to the amount and type of radiation these will emit, and the detrimental effect this will have on my health, and potentially on other residents of [suburb]. I include a letter from my General Practitioner (GP) in relation to the potential impact EMF radiation will have on my health. (ATTACH LETTER IF AVAILABLE) I refer the council to a journal article by Cindy L. Russell M.D., entitled ‘5G wireless telecommunications expansion: Public health and environmental implications’, which provides further information regarding the scope of the 5G network and its public health hazards. In addition, the ‘EUROPEAN EMF Guideline 2016 for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of EMF-related health problems and illnesses’, explains the link between RF exposure and serious human diseases. The opposition to the 5G roll-out is gaining traction in Perth, Australia wide, and other parts of the world. Recently Brussels, Geneva, as well as different States in America have moved to halt 5G rollouts in their cities due to the effects it would have on the health of its citizens. I urge the council to consider its responsibility in ensuring the health, wellbeing, and safety of the citizens of [suburb]. The strongest evidence has impelled international experts to call for an urgent stop to the deployment of 5G technology. This should sufficiently warrant the council to take the precautionary principle and to do the same. I am therefore asking the council to prevent any further expansion of 5G infrastructure in the city of [suburb] until further research can verify its safety. Specifically, I am asking the council to take action in ensuring that no 4GX or 5G small cell/antenna or any cells/antenna related to 5G technology will be installed near my premise [home/office/shop] and any existing ones to be switched off, and be removed immediately. Please reply within the next 7 days with the actions the council will take to respond to my request. Sincerely,
Dear xxxxx I am XXXX, and I am writing to you today about the importance of having a healthy immune system during this time where people are so concerned about SARS-Cov-2; and how the Government’s endorsement of the 5G network deployment (and current fast-tracking thereof), will cause harm to the general population at a time where we are being told to remain healthy and look after our immune systems. Individuals with compromised immune systems are in the high-risk category for developing Covid-19 once being infected with SARS-Cov-2, and governing bodies have advised that individuals with a compromised immune system should be especially vigilant during the pandemic of Covid-19(1). Given that people’s immune systems are susceptible to the effects of electromagnetic radiation, and these effects will be worsened by 5G, it is of great concern that Telstra has commenced its trials of the 5G millimetre wave at 26GHz and has announced that it is bringing “forward $500m of capital spending on our networks from next financial year to this calendar year to accelerate the 5G rollout and support the economy”(2). Of particular concern is the fact that Telstra’s 5G trials will not assess health effects on nearby people and environment. In consideration of the above, I seek the explanation as to why 5G is being rolled out rapidly across Australia when the health effects of 5G have not been adequately studied and the Parliamentary Inquiry into 5G is incomplete. I request answers to the following questions and ask that you not respond with assurances that Australia’s levels are safe because they comply with the ARPANSA ‘standard’(3), as the ARPANSA Standard is outdated and incomplete (4), and Australia has the highest allowable power density limits in the world, at 1000uW/cm2, while other countries are as low as 10-100uW/cm2 (5). 1. There is a large body of scientific evidence demonstrating that EMFs negatively affect one’s immune system and other body functions. We are already exposed to high levels of EMFs – why at this crucial time, would we add to this already unsafe exposure (see for example (a) to (l) below)? a.

The Parliamentary 5G Inquiry is still open and there has been no conclusion (6). There were 537 submissions (the vast majority being against 5G), including extensive submissions backed by scientific evidence from organisations such as the Oceania Radiofrequency Scientific Advisory Association (ORSAA) and Environment and Communities Safe From Radiation (ECSFR). Why is the information provided by these experts being ignored? Why are telcos not consulting the independent scientific community (a major stakeholder) who has expressed grave concerns about the risks 5G and called for a moratorium on the roll-out? Why is the 5G rollout going ahead before when this Inquiry has been completed? 3. Dr Steve Conway (Swinburne University of Technology) stated on The Project on March 22nd that, “5G has a very small signal range... That means every 100 metres you are going to need physical infrastructure…”. Both Dr Conway and Laurie Patton (Vice President – Telecommunications Society of Australia) point out that the solution to the current demand for Internet usage is to fix the NBN, for which we already have the existing infrastructure. It seems obvious that NBN is the best option on so many levels, such as health, security, economics and timeliness. Please explain why this option is not being prioritised. 4. Given that our Government has pledged that the health of the Australian citizens is more important than economic growth during this time, please provide evidence (if any exists) that implementing untested 5G infrastructure will benefit the health of Australian citizens and that it will not lead to disruption of primary services such as power and telecommunications, both of which are critical during this “State of Emergency”. 5. Can the Government assure the people of Australia that no conflicts of interest exist in the National Covid 19 Coordination Commission, particularly with respect to Executive Board members who have ties to the telecommunications industry, as these could well sway decisions in favour of telecommunitcations industry to detriment of the health of the Australian people. Failure to respond with detailed particularity to questions and concerns that the general public has previously raised shall be considered as a blatant and negligent disregard for the health and well-being of the Australian people. Given the severity of this matter I request that a response is provided by the addressee within 10 business days of receipt of this letter. Kind regardsA long, quiet struggle over the introduction of a new era of "4G/5G" microwave transmitters in Berkeley neighborhoods erupted into violence between midnight and dawn on October 5. Once again, the issue involved a struggle between local autonomy and corporate hegemony.

As the Natural Resources Defense Fund notes, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has sided with the Telecom giants (Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, etc) and "eliminated environmental and historical review for siting certain cell towers and other wireless facilities." Under FCC law, states, towns, and individuals are specifically prohibited from citing health or environmental concerns when objecting to the planned "roll-out" of hundreds of thousands of wireless antennas that need to be placed every 500 feet in business districts and neighborhoods.

The FCC also refuses to update outmoded health and environmental guidelines for electromagnetic frequency (EMF) exposures that were set in the early 1990s.

AT&T is now starting to install the first of these new transmitters on already over-burdened wooden power poles next to the Monterey Market, Berkeley Natural Foods, the Berkeley Unified School District building and the Thousand Oaks Primary School.

Scores of North Berkeley neighbors have complained that they never received the required legal notices that were supposed to alert them to the planned installations and thereby unwittingly lost their right to appeal the installations outside their homes. The residents also insist that current existing telecom services are more than adequate and they neither need, nor want, additional small-cell transmitters on their streets.

One of the concerned residents living near the Gilman Street pole was Clifford Fred, a Former Planning Commissioner. Fred was outraged: “I’m shocked that city officials knew that AT&T violated Berkeley Municipal Code 16.10.040 by not notifying people within 500 feet of the 1321 Gilman or 1550 Hopkins poles before the controversial cell towers were approved, but let AT&T get away with violating the city laws. Officials used to care but now are keen on letting big telecom companies have their way.”

In response to these incursions, a coalition of neighbors and activists calling themselves WiRED (Wireless Radiation Education and Defense) has been showing up at the targeted sites to quietly challenge the work crews—and occasionally finding the work permits to be unsigned or flawed. WiRED argues that installing small-cell wireless antennas does not qualify as "essential work" during the pandemic.

In most cases, the interactions between workers, officers and demonstrators has remained respectful and peaceful with the work crews usually packing up and leaving the area. As WiRED activist Phoebe Anne Sorgen noted: "the cops made it clear that they'd rather not arrest us" and provided "plenty of opportunity to avoid arrest." But recently, tensions have begun to escalate.

On September 21, WiRED volunteers (alerted by local neighbors) showed up at 1:30AM to confront workers setting up security fences around a pole on Gilman Street. With eight Berkeley police on hand, one activist recalled, "we pushed as far as we dared and were threatened with arrest several times but were not arrested."

On October 5, a group of ten WiRED "pole watchers" (including some "camping out" in a tent pitched on the sidewalk next to the disputed pole on Gilman were reportedly "man-handled" by a contingent of BPD officers who physically assaulted the activists. Sorgen (a veteran of many protests) said her treatment "wasn't excessive" though "there's a sore spot on one forearm" from being dragged down the street "because I went limp."

According to witnesses, at least 20 police showed up. One officer announced: "If you don't want to get arrested, get out of the way" but that was immediately followed with the order: "Every officer grab a person!"

"It was really brutal and bad," according to Juty Blue, who was standing vigil at the Gilman pole. "It was 3:30 morning and there were only eight of us, which made it easier for police to rough us up. They grabbed and pulled and pushed people. They were rude and horrible."

Sierra Murphree, who was occupying a tent on the sidewalk, was dragged away from the pole while still inside the tent.

At the same time, a smaller contingent of protesters was confronted by police at the construction site near the Monterey Market. A 61-year-old protestor named Jason Winnett suffered a pulled muscle after being roughed-up by the officers. Meaveen O'Connor was left with bruises on her body and CodePink campaigner Cynthia Papermaster said the police were so aggressive she feared "they were going to break my arm."

Mayor Jesse Arreguin responded by saying was shocked to learn of the confrontation and found the reports of police abuse "troubling." The mayor, along with several councilmembers, promised to investigate.

An Open Letter to the City Leaders

Berkeley resident Juty Blue (an eyewitness to the above events) sent the following Public Comment to the City Council during its October 6 meeting to discuss an evaluation of City Manager Dee Williams-Ridley:

"Hello Mayor and City Council,

"I am extremely disappointed that the City Manager has directed the Berkeley Police to crack down hard on peaceful protesters, especially people protesting the installation of 5G cell towers. A group of peaceful protesters were at 1321 Gilman and 1550 Hopkins early Monday morning Oct 5, in anticipation of AT&T installing dangerous and ugly cell towers on the utility poles at both locations. At 3:30am, the subcontractors, a fence rental company and a traffic control company all showed up at both sites. The protesters blocked their access to the utility poles for about 30 minutes. Then the Berkeley police showed up in force - about 10 at both sites. They surrounded the protesters. One officer said that anyone who did not want to get arrested should leave. But immediately an order went out for each police officer to grab one protester.

"Thus people were NOT given an opportunity to leave the site. Six people at 1321 Gilman were grabbed roughly and dragged some distance away or across the street. Most of these people were in their 60's and 70's. People were bruised up. One woman lost her glasses. Four or five protesters at the Hopkins site were treated in a similar manner, or even more roughly. One woman at Hopkins thought a police officer broke her arm.

"As work could not begin until 7am, there was no reason for the police to act in this fashion. One officer told one of us the order to quickly disperse the protesters came from the "City," not the Police Chief . . . . This police officer said that AT&T demanded this action from the City and would reimburse the city for its expenses. If true, this is very troubling.

"We are also angry that the City Manager is allowing this work to proceed, even though AT&T violated [Berkeley Municipal Code] BMC 16.10.040 by not notifying people within 500 feet of these utility poles before the cell tower permits were approved.

"The City Manager has never responded to the numerous letters to her from Berkeley citizens complaining that the approval of these cell towers violates the Berkeley Municipal code. The City Manager and police should be working for the town's citizens, NOT for large corporations."Proposed Lawsuit Could Save Lake Tahoe & Other Sensitive Environments from 5G Telecom Takeovers. A group of residents from South Lake Tahoe, California are planning to launch arguably one of the most critical environmental lawsuits of 2020. But they need your help to do it.


Lake Tahoe, straddling both California and Nevada, is the second deepest lake in the United States, a pristine environment treasured by millions and home to endangered species. But thanks to profit-hungry telecom companies and their “captured” regulator at Tahoe, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA), this magical place is on the fast-track to destruction.


Over 100 unregulated, radiation-emitting 5G antennas have already been installed throughout the area, and the TRPA is getting ready to approve the construction of a 112-foot cell tower smack in the middle of Bald Eagle habitat!


If we don’t stop TRPA now, Lake Tahoe as we know it will not survive the looming telecom takeover.


Lawyers are ready to go to federal court to ensure that the TRPA doesn’t get away with ruining Tahoe forever. If successful, the case will protect the Lake from future wireless infrastructure deployments and could even set legal precedent for our National Parks and other sensitive environments.
DO THE BENEFITS OUTWEIGH THE HARMS?
Will millions of wireless antennas on earth, tens of thousands of satellites filling our skies, billions of sensors and cameras squeezing from our world every âbitâ of data imaginable, provide overall benefit or harm to our infinitely fine-tuned web of life?

As digitalization spirals out of control in an ever-expanding web of technology gone rogue, perhaps itâs time to consider whether the harms outweigh the hoped for and hyped about benefits.

Below is a brief overview of some of the reasons people around the world are sounding the alarm about 5G and calling for safer wired technology.

HEALTH
5G is a massive biological experiment inflicted on the public without informed consent, with no prior safety testing, and with credible scientific evidence indicating this technology will prove harmful to health and potentially fatal to some.
Once 4G/5G antennas are densely installed in communities around the globe and interacting with tens of thousands of satellites polluting our skies, no one will be able to escape continuous, involuntary exposure to non-ionizing radiation. The unborn child, young children, the elderly, and people with chronic illnesses, microwave sickness, or compromised immune systems will be particularly vulnerable.

The 2015 International EMF Scientist Appeal. signed by more than 240 scientists with published peer-reviewed research on the biologic and health effects of wireless radiation states:

âNumerous recent scientific publications have shown that EMF affects living organisms at levels well below most international and national guidelines. Effects include increased cancer risk, cellular stress, increase in harmful free radicals, genetic damages, structural and functional changes of the reproductive system, learning and memory deficits, neurological disorders, and negative impacts on general well-being in humans. Damage goes well beyond the human race, as there is growing evidence of harmful effects to both plant and animal life.â

Our children depend on us and on government leaders around the globe to protect health and safety and to place these above all else.

WILDLIFE
Many animals and plants depend on the earthâs magnetic field for navigation, breeding, food, migration and indeed survival. Recently reported research shows current levels of artificial radiation are already interfering with these biological processes.
âBiologists have discovered that wireless electromagnetic radiation disturbs internal magneto-receptors used for navigation, as well as disrupting other complex cellular and biologic processes in mammals, birds, fish, insects, trees, plants, seeds and bacteria with profound impacts on the natural environmentâ Cindy Russell, Physicians For Safe Technology.

Radiation has also been implicated in Colony Collapse Disorder. The shorter millimeter wave frequencies that will be used for 5G will be yet more perilous than 2G, 3G, and 4G, as insects are millimeter-sized creatures and will selectively absorb and amplify these frequencies.

The destiny of all life forms depends on us making wise decisions now.

PRIVACY
Enabled by millions of new 4G/5G antennas, the Internet of Things, Smart Cities, and Smart Regions will generate an extraordinary amount of data. As Surveillance Capitalism expert Sue Halpern explains,
â5G will catalogue exactly where someone has come from, where they are going, and what they are doing.â Sue Halpern | The New Yorker. The Terrifying Potential of the 5G Network.

Our data will be collected, mined, analyzed, and stored indefinitely in data centers. It will be sold and used for targeted marketing (aka surveillance capitalism), surveillance, law enforcement, research, smart cities systems, and more as the IoT evolves. In fact, a whole interconnected system is being built as data from one application provides fodder for another.

Data of course will also be used by hackers for their purposes as wireless systems are far more easily hacked than wired connections.

Our data is extraordinarily valuable and can be used for convenience, research, profit, surveillance, and control. DataÂ is one of the main driving forces behind 5G and an all-things-connected world.

OUR CHILDREN
Research on wireless communications technologies shows technology has profound effects on our brains and humanity. Suicide, loneliness, and depression are reaching epidemic proportions. Professor Jean Twenge from San Diego State University says âYoung people are on the brink of the worst mental health crisis in decades.â
Tech-addiction is on the rise. Gaming Disorder is now included in the World Health Organization, International Classification of Diseases. Teenagers are showing signs of addiction from watching screens nine hours per day, while being exposed to non-ionizing radiation from Wi-Fi and their devices. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that doctors prescribe âcreative unplugged play-timeâ for children. The need for such a recommendation is a sad commentary on the current state of affairs.

Our kids need more time with one another andÂ in nature, and less with technology and screens. 5G will worsen the problem of dependence on, and addiction to technology.

We have allowed industry to define who we are, what we do, and where we are headed as a species. We and our children deserve better. We donât need more internet-connectivity, we need more connection.

ENERGY CONSUMPTION
Armed with an astronomical amount of data generated from the 5G-enabled Internet of Things (IoT), Smart Cities, and Smart Regions, industry claims we will be better equipped to save energy. But what they fail to include in their analyses is the mega energy footprint of all these internet-connected things humming and buzzing 24/7. It is not at all clear that the IoT will ever succeed in offsetting its own fast growing and unbounded energy footprint.
Not considered are:

The energy consumed by all these constantly-communicating âthingsâ machines, applications, sensors, surveillance cameras, etc.
The astronomical amount of energy needed to manufacture all these IoT things, devices and accompanying infrastructure (embodied energy).
The CO2 released into the atmosphere from the energy used to power the proliferating wireless sources. Most of this energy is generated from fossil fuels.
The energy required to power enormously energy consumptive data centers.
The excess energy needed to move data wirelessly through the air rather than more efficiently and effectively through fiber or cable.
An all-things-connected world is not the answer to saving energy.

E-WASTE
With the Internet of Things (IoT), household items such as washing machines, mattresses, tea kettles, plant-waterers etc. will join the ranks of e-waste. Will recycling be enough, and will our earth be able to âdigestâ this fast-growing volume of e-waste?
In a Business World article, Nurit Kanti explains: âWith lack of proper barriers to prevent this leakage [of toxic substances], and the high concentration of these toxic substances, the impact of the e-waste on the ecosystem is extremely long-lasting, irreversible and dangerous to the sustainability of everyone around that eco-system.â

E-waste from discarded products is only part of the problem. A far more significant contributor to e-waste is the release of toxins from mining and manufacturing electronics. In an article in The Conversation, author Josh Lepawsky explains, âNo amount of post-consumer recycling can recoup the waste generated before consumers purchase their devices.â

CONFLICT MINERALS
âTheyâre digging in trenches and laboring in lakes, hunting for treasure in a playground from Hell. Hard enough for an adult man. Unthinkable for a child.â CBS News finds children mining cobalt for batteries in the Congo.
The production of our electronic technologies has fueled war, murder, rape, and child labor in the Congo. According to World Without Genocide at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law, approximately 6 million people have died as a result conflicts fueled by the pursuit of rare earth minerals needed for our electronics.

Children and women also suffer. Unicef estimated that in 2016, there were about 40,000 children working in mines across the Congo. Hundreds of thousands of women have been raped and sold back to villages for ransom. Casualties of a war financed primarily by the electronics industry.

5G and the Internet of Things will likely bring more hardship, child labor, and deaths as the industry driven push for an all-things-connected world consumes and ravages us and Earth.

DEATH KNELL FOR CYBER SECURITY
The World Global Research Report ranked cyber security as the third greatest global risk in 2018 topped only by natural disasters and extreme weather events. With the arrival of the IoT and billions of new internet-connected machines, appliances, sensors, things, robots, devices, etc. â all enabled and supported by 5G â cyber-attacks have become virtually inevitable. Furthermore, a wireless system is far more vulnerable to cyber-attacks than a wired system.
Cyber security expert, Bruce Schneier states:
âWith the advent of the Internet of Things and cyber-physical systems in general, weâve given the Internet hands and feet: the ability to directly affect the physical world. What used to be attacks against data and information have become attacks against flesh, steel, and concrete.â

Restated:
âGive the Internet hands and feet, and it will have the ability to punch and kick.

RESILIENCY
Cell towers fail to hold up under disaster conditions. They failed in the fires in California as well as in the hurricanes in Puerto Rico and Texas.
The Wall Street Journal reported, âWireless networks along the Texas coast suffered outages as a result of Hurricane Harvey, federal regulators said, leaving customers in some counties with limited or no cellphone service.â

Wired technologies such as copper, coaxial and fiber are vastly more resilient than cell towers.

LIABILITY
Telecoms admit they do not know if their wireless technology is safe. They warn shareholders that revenues could be negatively impacted by health claims. Neither will insurance companies insure telecoms against liability for exposure-related health claims.

Who will be held liable in the event of harm from a wireless âsmall cellâ facility? Who will assume financial responsibility for future injury, fire, loss of health, property devaluation etc. due to close proximity of cell antennas to homes, workplaces, and schools?

There Is A Safer Alternative
Thankfully, there is a safer, more reliable, tried and true solution that we have had for well over 20 years –Â fiber/wiredÂ technology. If we used wired connections for the vast majority of internet and telecommunicationsÂ needs, reserving wirelessÂ for an ancillary service â we could enjoy the benefits of technology whileÂ minimizing the harms.

Wired technologies such as fiber or coaxial cable are faster, more reliable, resilient,Â energy-efficient, and more easily defended from cyber attacks. Above all, wired technologies are significantly less hazardous toÂ our health and would better ensure the survival of other life forms with whom we share this planet.

Do you know the health risks associated with 5G? While mobile phone users have the option to use a headset, a speakerphone, a car phone or not to use a cell phone at all if they choose, no such option exists for people who live in close proximity to a 5G wireless antenna. The issue here is involuntary exposure.

So great to see Centerville Concerned Citizens included on this list of organizations fighting for safer technology in our communities!

Below is the press conference with Senator Blumenthal discussing 5G. Also, the bottom link is contact information to put you in touch with his office to thank him for excersizing caution in regards to 5G.

I just called Blumenthal’s offices to show my support, and was thrilled to hear they have been fielding MANY phone calls from concerned citizens worried about the possibilty of 5G coming to their neighborhoods. The numbers to call are: 1-860-258-6940 or 1-800-334-5341. It only takes two minutes. Please call! Thanks!!  – Janet

We just received this email from one of our many supporters. It’s great to see Senator Blumenthal isn’t the only elected member of Congress concerned with 5G and its many potential health risks! The email is from an organization called Environmental Working Group. Here is their latest email update:

BREAKING: Members of Congress call on FCC to investigate health risks of 5G wireless technology.
Stand with EWG and urge the FCC to make sure new wireless technologies are SAFE!

Dear Member,
BIG NEWS: Congress is demanding answers about the safety of the 5G wireless technology being unleashed across our cities and towns.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Rep. Anna Eshoo of California want the Federal Communications Commission to prove that 5G technology is safe.

Sen. Blumenthal stated, “We need to know whether the radio frequencies can cause cancer.”

We couldn’t agree more.

Cellphone radiation has been linked to serious health risks like brain cancer, sperm damage and changes in memory. These health impacts alarm consumers – with good reason – but tech companies and the government are doing little to ensure that the technologies we rely on are safe. Instead they are expanding their usage.

We need the FCC to require these telecom mega-corporations to test their technologies, like 5G, for safety before they’re installed from coast to coast.

Take Action: Tell the FCC to prove new wireless technologies are SAFE before they’re installed in our neighborhoods!

Current regulations regarding wireless safety were adopted more than 20 years ago and have not been updated for the latest generation of technology. With 5G wireless technology being implemented in cities from coast to coast, we need answers now.

Activists and researchers have been sounding the alarm for years, especially for children’s health. A staggering 40 percent of American children under the age of eight have their own tablets or similar products.

New research continues to reveal serious health concerns associated with cellphone radiation:
•A new study revealed that cellphone radiation may damage teenagers’ memory performance.
•Earlier this year, the largest-ever animal study confirmed that cellphone radiation increases the risk of cancer, including tumors in the brain and heart.
•In 2011, the World Health Organization declared cellphone radiation a “possible carcinogen” based on studies of long-term cellphone users.

Telecom giants have been testing their new technologies on the unsuspecting public for long enough. It’s time the FCC ensures wireless technologies are safe before they’re released to the public.

Take action on cellphone radiation! Join EWG and tell the FCC to protect Americans from new wireless technologies!

Thanks for standing with us. – EWG Action Alert

Here is a letter sent by Lorraine O’Connor, owner for 41 years, (and counting!) of the 1856 Country Store which is next door to the South Congregational Church which just made a deal with T Mobile to install a cell tower:

My name is Lorraine O’Connor and I live at 555 Main Street in Centerville. My husband and I purchased the 1856 Country Store in Centerville 41 years ago. We fell in love with Centerville on one of our many visits to Cape Cod. I knew I was destined to one day own the Country Store and when it became available in 1977 we jumped at the chance to make it ours. I never imagined our lovely village of Centerville would be embroiled in such a controversial situation as the one we find ourselves in now.
When I learned a cell tower was being installed next door in the South Congregational Church steeple I was both shocked and saddened by the news. I would hope if we were given an offer to change the use of our store by a large corporation we would give consideration to our neighbors and notify them of any significant changes we would be making to the landscape of our village. Knowing that the cell tower poses serious health implications for our community causes me deep concern. This special place, where I see children daily running through our doors at the store after a morning or afternoon at the playground will forever be changed if this tower is allowed to move forward. So many young children visit Main Street daily.I’m picturing a circle of children enjoying the library story hour just feet from this cellular steeple. How do we explain to the children of Centerville that the adults around them did not operate under a code of common sense and decency and put their needs first? How proud would we be as a community to have a voice in setting safer standards for the placement of these towers.
Thank you for your time,

Lorraine O’Connor
1856 Country Store

Please join us this Wednesday, Nov. 7th at 7 pm at Town Hall. We need to bring peace back to the village of Centerville and let T-Mobile know they need to look elsewhere to install their antennas!!!

Dear Friends:
We are writing to ask for much-needed donations to our Go Fund Me page to help fund our fight to stop the cell tower in the South Congregational Church. Here is the link: https://www.gofundme.com/centerville-concerned-citizens
We continue to be encouraged by developments and we have every reason to believe we will win in the end. However we also feel that T-Mobile is not going to concede and go away. They appear to be ready to fight this for as long as they need to in order to get the tower approved.
T-Mobile’s efforts to obtain either a special permit or use variance from the Zoning Board of Appeals so far has not been successful but their requests are still pending before that board. In the end, if T-Mobile is not successful at the local level, we believe they will pursue this though other avenues, including federal court.
PLEASE CONSIDER DONATING to our Go Fund Me page to allow this fight to continue. All donations of any size are greatly appreciated. The money is being used primarily to pay our lawyer, Paul Revere, who has been very generous with his time and fees. If not for Mr. Revere, the tower would on right now. We are also using it to pay for expenses like yard signs, mailings, literature and similar expenses. Our efforts over the past six months have taken most of the more than $4,600 raised so far, leaving us with very little left at the present.
Thank you again for all your support.

The government should remove Chinese firm Huawei from the UK's 5G network by 2025 instead of 2027, as planned, ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith has said.

The telecoms company is to be banned from setting up 5G, but will remain involved in 3G and 4G.

Mr Duncan Smith said allowing Huawei to work on these also posed a continued "risk" to national security.

But the government said it would "ensure" the UK's communications system was as "secure as it possibly can be".

Huawei, which has repeatedly said it would not cause harm to any country, predicted the UK would now be pushed "into the digital slow lane", with higher bills for consumers.

Huawei 5G kit must be removed from UK by 2027
BT: Impossible to ditch Huawei in under 10 years
Could Huawei be out of the UK by 2024?
In January, ministers announced the company would be kept out of the sensitive core of the 5G network - including national intelligence - but be allowed involvement in up to 35% of other parts.

This prompted criticism from backbench Conservative MPs, marshalled by Mr Duncan Smith, who called Huawei an arm of the Chinese Communist Party and a risk to the UK.

The US, with which the UK shares much of its intelligence, also applied diplomatic pressure for a rethink.

Under its revised plans, the government says Huawei will not be allowed to install any equipment for the 5G network from next year - and its existing equipment will be removed by 2027.

But Mr Duncan Smith told the House of Commons that the head of BT thought the removal could happen two years earlier.

He said: "I do think he [Mr Dowden] can do it quicker than this... There's no reason why it can't [happen]."

Presentational grey line
Analysis box by Nick Eardley, political correspondent
The government thought it had made its decision on Huawei earlier this year. It wanted to get on with delivering faster internet and thought Huawei was best placed to ensure speedy upgrades.

But since then the US has continued to apply pressure - with its decision to impose new sanctions on China a crucial factor.

Meanwhile, dozens of Tory backbenchers continued their opposition - and refused to fall in line. They have cautiously welcomed the announcement that the UK is moving away from Huawei - but they want things to move faster. Some are also uneasy that the company's technology will stay in the 3G and 4G network.

This decision wasn't without cost though. Ministers admit it will delay the rollout of 5G across the UK and will cost significant amounts of money - into the billions. They've also had to consider warnings from telecoms providers about service provision.

Ultimately though, the combination of political pressure - international and domestic - has won the debate in government.

Presentational grey line
Mr Duncan Smith added that there were "contradictions" in banning Huawei from 5G but not 3G and 4G, which would undergo "software upgrades"by Huawei "for the next decade".

"So, if they're a risk to us in 5G, why are they not a risk to us generally?" he asked.

Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden replied: "The reality of the 5G network is that it is fundamentally different and it's a recognition of that fundamental difference that we are imposing these rules for 5G.

"Of course, over time... 5G will be replaced by 6G, and in all of that Huawei will be absent."

He also said: "There is of course no such thing as a perfectly secure network, but the responsibility of the government is to ensure that it is as secure as it possibly can be."

Labour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy described the announcement as a "welcome, long-overdue step" but accused the government of having "no consistent approach" to China.

Speaking to the BBC, she said said that, while one department is "seeking to ban them from the 5G network", another is "considering handing over technology involved in our nuclear industry to the Chinese government."

SNP culture spokesman John Nicolson said it had been wrong in the first place to allow Huawei near the "nervous system" of the UK's telecoms network.

And Labour MP Chris Bryant told the Commons there was "unity" among MPs in opposition to the company's further involvement in 5G, saying: "I wish the government would listen to its own backbenchers."

The US has claimed China could use Huawei to "spy, steal or attack" the UK - but the company denies this and its founder has said he would rather shut the company down than do anything to damage its clients.

Sanctions imposed in May by Washington have limited China's access to US chip technology, which prompted the UK's National Cyber Security Centre to launch a review of the use of Huawei.
Following a pledge made last month, Twitter has started displaying fact-checking labels on tweets linking 5G mobile technology to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. Clicking these labels leads users to a thread titled, “No, 5G isn’t causing coronavirus,” with links to news articles and official sources debunking the persistent conspiracy theory.

Global health authorities are in full agreement that COVID-19 is a respiratory disease triggered by a new viral strain. But at the same time, a growing international movement of conspiracy theorists are adamant that 5G networking equipment is weakening immune systems and spreading coronavirus, threatening the burgeoning technology revolution still only in its infant stages.

How did we get here?
Conspiracy theories about the supposed threat of mobile radio to human health are not new, and the idea has evolved in 2020 to use the spread of the coronavirus as “proof” of the risks posed by 5G technology. As it stands, there is not a shred of evidence that radio waves pose a health risk to humans.

This latest strain of “radiophobia” was borne by a Belgian newspaper interview with general practitioner Kris Van Kerckhoven in January. During the interview, Van Kerckhoven was asked to comment on a number of 5G cell towers recently installed near Wuhan, and a possible link to the then-localised coronavirus outbreak. “I have not done a fact check”, Van Kerckhoven warned, “But it may be a link with current events”.

The doctor’s two cents have ultimately proved very expensive for Europe. They kicked conspiracies into overdrive, turning a small group of crackpot theorists into an opaque cross-border threat that has gathered enough momentum to attract ever more fervent followers. Many of whom have proved willing to set 5G masts ablaze across Europe, including in France, Germany, the UK and the Netherlands. Anti-5G fanaticism is manifesting across the Atlantic as well, with a Canadian cell tower targeted late last month.

An increasingly popular idea is that the current health crisis has been deliberately manufactured by global elites, the likes of which include Bill Gates, George Soros, and the faceless “Big Pharma” threat, to roll-out mandatory vaccinations loaded with 5G-activated tracking chips.

The theory has apparently proved as believable as it is elaborate. Polling data from the UK, US, France, Austria and Germany shows that the “man-made coronavirus” theory is a popular explanation for the pandemic: more than 60% of respondents in the UK agree with the statement to some degree, while a fifth of respondents agreed there was a link between coronavirus and 5G.

The social media-conspiracy nexus
The backbone of the growing anti-5G movement has been bolstered by social media networks, particularly specialized Facebook groups and chat channels active in each country. But while each country has its own specialised network, there’s a trend towards greater international cooperation between the activists, exemplified by coordinated events like a recent anti-5G summit, a worldwide protest day on 6 June, and the sharing of agendas and news across international groups.

Far from being deterred or educated by social media firms and governments cracking down on fake news and other bogus information, however, the movement is increasingly relocating to chat platforms Telegram where they prosper without oversight. The platform has garnered notoriety in recent years as a haven for groups from the far-left and  far-right, as well as terrorist organisations like ISIS.

Members of activist groups on social media have found themselves in thousands-strong communities of like-minded individuals, all promoting and sharing misinformation linking 5G to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. In April, Facebook blocked two major anti-5G groups, with a collective membership of more than 60,000 people, for promoting violence and the destruction of 5G network infrastructure.

At the same time, notable differences between the countries exist in terms of active calls for violence. Incitement to criminal damage against 5G infrastructure is well-documented in the UK, but anger in Italy has steadily escalated over several months as well. The high level of activism in Italy is characterised by demands to attack mobile towers in combination with potentially highly potent petitions.

For instance, a bizarre petition directed at presidents Putin and Trump has gathered a lot of attention among Italian activists. Purportedly speaking for all of Italy, the petition cites the conspiratorial views of Colonel Vladimir Kvachkov, a former Russian Military Intelligence Service, and calls in Russian and American forces to intervene militarily in Europe to stop the 5G roll-out.

Such fervent activity stands in marked contrast to Germany, where the anti-5G movement has been comparatively docile, at least for now. But considering that German Telegram groups have widely shared a video shot in Italy depicting the torching of a cell-phone tower, it’s plausible that the distrust may soon mutate into violent copy-cat action at a scale similar to that seen in other European countries.

Blind to the facts
It’s difficult to say how the threat will evolve over time. Yet a trend towards merging anti-5G fears with other issues, such as anti-globalization, anti-vax or radical environmentalism, can already be observed. The underlying premise is that modern life is a “corruption” of nature and a natural state of living, and the movement calls into question the advances of modern science in many fields – even though those who opposite these advances are the very same to benefit from them too. Perhaps the most poignant example is that of medicine.

The delivery of health services is traditionally constrained by geography and availability of healthcare workers, particularly in rural and low-income areas. The advent of remote monitoring systems and telehealth has helped overcome this hurdle somewhat – as seen the corona crisis – but remains limited by congestion and slow network speeds. With substantial connection power and substantial wireless speeds, 5G promises to break this bottleneck to unlock new innovations in the healthcare sector.

Indeed, the possibilities available to a 5G-enabled health sector are endless: large data files, such as medical imagery, could be transferred between facilities without lag; telemedicine services can expand to meet rising demand from rural areas; virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and spatial computing can be used to deliver less invasive treatments; and 5G-enabled “wearables” can monitor patients’ health in real-time.

Of course, none of this will be possible if the growing anti-5G movement seizes public policy discussions or succeeds in destroying 5G infrastructure. With the rate of new coronavirus cases worldwide barely slowing down, and China already experiencing a second wave, the anti-5G movement poses a health risk of potentially devastating proportions.
5G hype is coming. Don’t fall for it.

5g isn't so much about using the internet on your phone as it is about enabling entirely new types of services. 5g means stable low latency connections with massive through put. 5g is useful for flying drones through the mobile network, it is useful for cars sharing data such as hazards or that they are about to brake with nearby cars. 5g means that a police helicopter can live stream from several cameras straight to a screen in a police car.

5g means that machines can effectively be controlled from a distance. Construction crews, demolition work etc can be done remotely.

Outside of major cities 5g is going to be less about phones and more about other types devices that could benefit from fast and reliable internet.

But horribly worse signal strength. 5G is so weak that rain and moisture in the atmosphere attenuates the signal dramatically. They'll essentially have to put 5G nodes at every streetlight.

Sounds awesome. Can't even use it in my own house or in a park.

The latency benefit will be completely mitigated by the need to bounce the connection between many interconnected nodes to actually reach a gateway or the end destination.

The signals are blocked by buildings, and foliage can absorb much of their energy.

 I actually talked to the verizon techs installing the new fiber for the project. Its been stopped because the residents of the town complained about all the nodes going up on the telephone poles.

 5G is not only millimeter-wave frequencies. The first forays into 5G will be in the old lower band frequencies. <3GHz

 Huh, so it's a new transmission technology, not "5Ghz". Confusing!

 More nodes means fewer users per node which means higher speeds and and less latency. Have short range has been one of the major goals of 5g development. 5g will replace a few large towers with dozens of small access points, some not much bigger than regular routers.

 A bunch of folk want your toaster to be 5G capable.

As in your crappy unsecured IoT devices are going to become host to a botnt mesh network that doesn't need to access parts of the 5G network to piggyback activities.

IoT isn't called Internet of Shit for no reason. It's a different issue though.

Ok, but what if I'm in a not super populated area, like a random road in the middle of nowhere, or on the backside of a ski resort, and I want some signal, but don't need it to be super fast.

But then your car may not be able to tell Skynet where you are and how best to kill you. I mean keep you from getting in an accident.

That's a feature, not a bug.

Cool. Except I disagree. It's a design flaw.

More of a limitation of physics, right?

fewer users per node which means higher speeds and and less latency.

Just... no. Yes, lower latency for devices wanted to connect with one another on that node, but I don't want to connect to my neighbors phone or his refridgerator. I want to connect to a datacenter in California. And it's going to increase my latency to have to bounce my request through 16 different notes before I actually reach a gateway that can route my request appropriately. And if just one of those nodes in between is overloaded, that only compounds the problem.

Centralization is not a bad thing with IT infrastructure. The whole 5G architecture just doesn't work at scale. And we have no proof that it does.

5g will replace a few large towers with dozens of small access points, some not much bigger than regular routers

Great, more things to break. If existing ISPs are any indication, they'll rarely get serviced or fixed.

True, but someone decided to go ahead and use an inherently limiting waveband anyway.

No, he's saying there's a physical limitation to bandwidth over radio waves. Increase frequency to increase bandwidth at the cost of increased interference. It's a physical limitation.

There have been wireless DSL services forever that utilized lower frequencies for greater range and penetration, and the services failed. Sprint Broadband Direct was a big one.

Or just tie each node with fiber to the main hub the big cell tower would talk to previously. Now you have similar node to hub latency but greatly reduced free space latency with better transfer rates.

And don't forget it's even easier to block the antenna on your phone with your hands. I honestly feel like 5G is meant to compete with dsl and satellite internet, and that it will have an absolutely negligible impact on smartphones.

Satellite? The latency is going to be 2-4ms versus 60-70 now with dedicated emergency 2ms available.

They are saying a central server will be able to replace your card computer for self driving.

5G is also multiple frequencies, it will operate somewhere near 40GHz for the easy to block signals that are super fast and sub 6GHz that would relatively more hard to block than a stiff breeze. But still easier than 4G.

Skynet is getting closer to reality. Lol.

I’ve seen claims about strong signal strength bad for health as well. I don’t know if that has any truth to it though.

You’re confusing 5G wireless radio bands for 5G (5th generation) mobile broadband. These are separate concepts my dude.

No, I had it right. I'm talking about 5G, not 5Ghz wireless band. Read the article.

5G mobile wavebands are at much greater frequencies than 5 Ghz, and so are much worse at penetrating buildings and even the atmopshere.

5 Ghz wireless has significantly greater range than 5G mobile broadband. But you're right that 5 Ghz has less range than the older 2.4 Ghz networks.

While you are correct that these are components of 5g you are missing a lot of the pie here. The 5g standards havent even officially been rolled out yet and probably wont be rolled out until 2020 - 2023.

I can only assume that you are referring to the '5g' branded rollout of tech that Verizon is touting right now. The 5g standard is a lot more than that and ranges across a variety of connection protocols and hardware standards... some of which havent even been created yet.

What are you talking about? The standard has been finished since June.

That article is misleading. This is just the formal definition of what 5g consists of. The equivalent of defining a car as something that has 4 wheels and an engine.

No, it is equivalent to defining a hybrid or electric vehicle as "green" for a tax credit (ex.: Tesla) as long as it meets certain emissions standards. Or defining a car as a "supercar" if it can reach certain top speeds, acceleration, horsepower, etc. Your analogy is reductive and deliberately obtuse.

The specifications that hardware and networks must reach to be considered "5G" is everything. It gives electronics manufacturers a baseline to which they must at least match in order to be 5G. Defining 5G devices in any meaningful context beyond that is pointless, because there will be so many of them. I'm honestly confused as to what standards you are referring, because the 3GPP standards are considered the Bible for mobile data. Those are "the standards" according to...well, just about everyone.

Why would 5g offer lower latency than 4g? The signal still travels at exactly the same speed. And none of the tasks you listed require more bandwidth than 4g and the signal strength of 5g will be vastly worse making it even less reliable.

it's a myth, I have seen people claim that 5g will have latency of 1 MS or less. To do this you would need to communicate at a faster speed than speedlight in a distance server scenario.

To some of the morons here talking about this giving you cancer, 5G is not in the wavelength of ionizing radiation. It cannot give you cancer, and its cannot cook you either. Its far, far, far too weak for that.

but my birds falling from the sky

5g is so fast and has low latency that it might overtake hardwire broadband if you don't already have fiber in your house. It is also better at delivering internet than high quality wifi, so you might see private small range 5g routers being used by business.







A report in the German press claims that the government is going to impose new restrictions on Huawei’s involvement in the 5G network that amount to a ban in all but name.

The leak comes from Handelsblatt, so we are indebted to Google Translate for its help once more. It claims to have been chatting to the German government, which said that while there won’t be an outright ban on Huawei, the use of its kit will be severely restricted. They will be subject to both a technical and political test, the latter supposedly to determine Huawei’s intrinsic trustworthiness.

Since pretty much all countries that want to stay in America’s good books deem Huawei untrustworthy merely by being Chinese, it’s hard to see how Huawei could pass the political test. As an expert it quoted as saying in the piece, this is effectively an exclusion of Huawei, but the German government seems to be trying to sugar the pill.

It looks like German security agencies aren’t al all keen on Huawei and the government seems to be setting the stage for them to make the final call on Huawei kit. If this report is accurate then the German government is once more trying a similar move to the UK by repackaging a political decision as a security one. Both countries presumably hope this offers their best chance of retaining some goodwill with China despite banning Huawei.

All this stuff isn’t set to be made into law for another month or so and the German government has yet to formally announce anything. But if it’s accurate then we can expect the rest of the EU to follow Germany’s lead, because that’s what it does. Due to the severe cost implications for German operators, they will have to be given years to adapt to the new rules, but it’s starting to look like Europe could be a Huawei-free zone by the end of this decade.

Open Letter to Elon Musk & SpaceX
SUBJECT: Of bees, humans, and satellites
Dear Elon Musk, Kimbal Musk and all SpaceX Board Members, Officers, and Lead Investors, 
In 1962, when Rachel Carson published Silent Spring, insects were so thick upon this Earth that you could not drive a car very far, anywhere in the world, without its windshield becoming splattered with their bodies.
Ms. Carson would not recognize the world today: Windshields are clean. Birds are starving. Crops have no pollinators. A solution has been suggested for farmers: robotic bees, which are being developed at Harvard University. But that is not a solution for the world, because as the insects go, so go we.
And the world knows this. Why have millions of people joined environmental organizations? Why did Jeff Bezos just create a $10 billion-dollar environmental fund? Why are wealthy people signing up to go live on Mars and leave the Earth behind? Because our home is being destroyed, and on some level everyone knows this. But they do not know why. Yes, there are climate change, habitat destruction, and insecticides, but those cannot explain the 76 to 82 percent decline in flying insects in 63 nature preserves in Germany. Those cannot explain the 97 to 98 percent decline in crawling insects in a pristine rainforest in Puerto Rico.
If you expose honey bees to an ordinary cell phone for just ten minutes, their metabolism shuts down. Carbohydrates, fats, and proteins build up in their blood. They can no longer metabolize their food or utilize the oxygen they breathe. And since the same radiation is bathing us all, to a greater or lesser degree, everywhere on Earth, the same thing is happening to every living thing. It happens faster in bees than in us because bees have a much higher metabolism. The radiation comes from all forms of wireless technology, on Earth and in space, and it is being treated as if it is not there.
We are writing to you at this time because SpaceX is in process of surrounding the Earth with a network of thousands of satellites whose very purpose is to irradiate every square inch of the Earth. SpaceX, like everyone else, is treating the radiation as if it were not there. As if the mitochondria in our cells do not depend on electrons moving undisturbed from the food we digest to the oxygen we breathe. As if our nervous systems and our hearts are not subject to radio frequency interference like any piece of electronic equipment. As if the cancer, diabetes, and heart disease that now afflict a majority of the Earth’s population are not metabolic diseases that result from interference with our cellular machinery. As if insects everywhere, and the birds and animals that eat them, are not starving to death as a result.
We write to you today to ask you to halt the Starlink project because it is so destructive. Although the satellites are a few hundred miles high, even the tiny levels of radiation that will reach the surface of the Earth are higher than levels from solar storms that have been correlated with beachings of whales — whales that live in oceans which until now have hardly been subject to manmade radiation at all. And the satellites are being located in the Earth’s ionosphere, which controls the global electric circuit that we all evolved with, and that travels through the bodies of all living things on its way from sky to Earth, through Earth and oceans, and back up to the sky during thunderstorms. We pollute this circuit with billions of electronic frequencies at our peril.
We ask you to halt this project and sit down and meet with us, and with our scientific colleagues, and with our colleagues from the astronomical community, who have just formed the Safeguarding the Astronomical Sky Foundation (SASF). The sky belongs to everyone. The consequences of filling it with thousands — potentially tens of thousands — of disposable satellites are many:
	•	radiation
	•	visible pollution of the night sky
	•	interference with astronomy and meteorology
	•	rocket exhaust, contributing to ozone depletion and climate change
	•	ground and water pollution from intensive use of increasingly many spaceports
	•	accumulating space debris
	•	continual deorbiting and burning up of aging satellites, polluting the atmosphere with toxic dust and smoke
	•	ever-increasing likelihood of collisions
	•	increasing risk of the Kessler syndrome
Do we really want to build learning gardens at our schools, that will be pollinated with robotic bees? Do the oceans and Antarctica and all rainforests and wildlife preserves really need the Internet? Do the immutable stars in the unchanging heavens really need competition from ten thousand or more moving lights? We believe in something better. For us. For our children. For insects and for all of life.
We await your response.
Sincerely,
Arthur Firstenberg, Scientist & Author, The Invisible Rainbow: A History of Electricity and Life, (2020)

Americans for Responsible Technology is a voluntary association of local community organizations and individuals who are committed to promoting new technologies that advance our common interests while protecting the health, safety, security, privacy and property values of all Americans.

​

We believe in science. Independent, peer-reviewed and published science unencumbered by industry influence is critical to decision-making that is in the best interests of the people.



We believe in policies that evolve with science. Scientific thought changes as new discoveries are made and old hypotheses are disproved. Government agencies must ensure that policies are updated as science evolves.



We believe we have a moral obligation to protect the next generation. Our children depend on us, and on government leaders, to protect their health, safety, security and well-being, and to place this obligation above all others.

​

We believe in local control over the deployment of technology in our neighborhoods. Americans elect local leaders to represent their interests and respond to the unique needs and aesthetics of each community.



We reject the rush to roll out 5G technology across America. This effort is based on outdated science. It is unwarranted and dangerous, eviscerates local control and places the interests of a single industry ahead of those of the American people.

​

We call on our representatives in Washington to heed the call of independent scientists, medical professionals and public health experts around the world who are warning of the dangers of this technology, and to reject any proposal to use public funds or public property to facilitate the deployment of expanded wireless networks.

Anti-5G Facebook groups are filled with antisemitic conspiracy theories and incitement to vandalism of 5G infrastructure.
Polling conducted on behalf of HOPE not hate this week has revealed some startling statistics about the spread of conspiracy theories surrounding 5G internet and COVID-19. Around 8% of the British public agree that the rollout of 5G internet is contributing to the spread of coronavirus, while 19% say they are unsure. Further illustrating its reach, 37% of the public say they have seen articles or videos discussing this theory in the past four weeks.

HOPE not hate have analysed a selection of fast-growing anti-5G Facebook groups and found a number of deeply worrying aspects of their content. We sent a dossier of evidence to Facebook, who have removed at least one group and much of the content we flagged. Their actions are welcome but we will continue to monitor the situation and hope to see further action in the coming weeks; as this report will show, these groups pose a particular risk to the safety and wellbeing of Facebook’s users and society as a whole.

The past week has seen at least twenty acts of vandalism and arson against mobile phone masts in the UK, instigated by a widespread conspiracy theory that links a variety of health problems to the rollout of 5G internet technology. The theory has existed for a number of years, but has received significantly higher attention in recent months due to the coronavirus epidemic and claims that it is either caused by 5G radiation or is a hoax to conceal its effects.

Posts and comments supporting the destruction of 5G telecommunications infrastructure are widespread in every anti-5G Facebook group we’ve examined. The prevalence of such comments may indicate either support for their views from the groups’ administrators or simply lax moderation, but in either case this represents a widespread and significant breach of Facebook’s community standards, which explicitly prohibit the promotion of criminal activity targeting people or property.


Antisemitic post from the STOP 5G U.K group
But there are other aspects of the content of these groups that are perhaps even more worrying. People seeking out information on the 5G controversy in Facebook groups will soon find themselves exposed to any number of alternative conspiracy theories, many only tangentially related to 5G, that incite mistrust not just of the government but of healthcare providers, scientists and public institutions. Many of these theories are implicitly or explicitly antisemitic, with the rollout of 5G and many other alleged crimes being laid at the feet of prominent Jewish individuals or organisations.

“This [5G rollout] is more scary than the nuclear bomb because people will be living zombies and slaves to zionist rich Ruling class“

Post from the 5G & Microwave Radiation group
Many of these groups are growing at a significant rate. The largest group we looked at, STOP 5G UK, added almost three thousand members in just 24 hours between the 6th and 7th of April and had almost 60,000 prior to its deletion. One of the smaller groups, Direct Action Against 5G, was created on March 31st and gained over 1400 members in its first week. This means that an ever-growing number of Facebook users are accessing posts that promote antisemitic conspiracies and criminal actions.

There are other dangerous forms of misinformation that pervade these groups. For example, group members frequently describe what they believe to be the symptoms of living in close proximity to 5G mobile masts, including persistent headaches, nausea, heart palpitations and tinnitus. Anyone suffering persistent symptoms like these should be strongly advised to seek urgent medical attention; misdiagnosing the cause is likely to deter people from doing so and therefore highly dangerous. Moreover, the widespread belief in anti-5G groups that the coronavirus pandemic is a hoax to disguise the effects of the new technology pose a risk of disrupting measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Adherents of this theory will be less likely to observe vital hygiene and social distancing methods of preventing viral transmission if they do not believe that the symptoms are caused by a virus.


Antisemitic and far-right conspiracies from the STOP 5G U.K group.
Below are example posts from three of the UK-based anti-5G Facebook groups we looked at. They represent only a small sample of similar posts within each group, and the three groups are just a small fraction of the broader anti-5G group network. They serve to illustrate the toxic cocktail of influences that exists in these groups, where antisemitic and anti-government conspiracies are combined with calls to illegal direct action. The rapid growth of these groups, combined with the dozens of acts of arson and vandalism that are linked to the movement, means there is a very real risk of escalation to violence against people, as well as a shift towards different, more sinister conspiracies.

STOP 5G U.K
With 59,000 members and hundreds of posts per day, STOP 5G U.K was the largest and most active UK-based anti-5G group prior to its deletion. In amongst the anti-5G discussion were hundreds of posts about unrelated conspiracies, including antisemitic posts about supposed Jewish control of the world and the pro-Trump ‘QAnon’ hoax.


This post combining antisemitic tropes, 9/11 conspiracy and the QAnon hoax gained 104 likes and 54 shares.

Comment sections within the group frequently involved group members ‘educating’ each other on different far-right conspiracy theories.

Comment sections were filled with incitement to criminal damage against 5G infrastructure.
5G & Microwave Radiation
Founded over two years ago, the 5G and Microwave Radiation group has seen its membership almost double in the past month, taking it to over 17,800 members. The group is awash with alternative conspiracy theories that have little to do with the apparent subject matter of the group, such as links to articles entitled ‘QAnon reveals Vatican Rothschild Reptilian Connection behind the Deep State’.


Scaremongering posts warn against vaccination and promote conspiracies about plans to ‘depopulate the world’.

5G awareness > The Truth
Created on 1st February 2020, the 5G awareness > The Truth group has gained almost 11000 members in just over two months. Group admins are proactive in encouraging members to invite their Facebook friends to join the group, and claim to have another five thousand membership requests waiting to be processed.

BREAKING NEWS: 25 Countries Participate in 5G Global Protest
5G, the next generation of wireless technology, has never been tested for long-term safety. Yet, the telecom industry continues to charge forward with its plans to connect every “thing" and “event" on Earth, a wireless web that will require the deployment of roughly 100,000 broadband satellites into space and millions of new terrestrial cell wireless antennas.


Increasingly discouraged by the lack of balanced media coverage on the 5G issue, thousands of people took to the streets on September 26th across 25 countries to raise awareness of 5G health and environmental risks, privacy issues, and next gen tech's projected massive carbon footprint.


According to Stop 5G International's most recent press release, protesters believe there is just too much at stake for the future to be governed by short-term, corporate interests.INTERNATIONAL APPEAL Stop 5G on Earth and in Space

There are 306,616 signatories from 214 nations and territories as of March 10th, 2021

To the UN, WHO, EU, Council of Europe and governments of all nations
We the undersigned scientists, doctors, environmental organizations and citizens from (__) countries, urgently call for a halt to the deployment of the 5G (fifth generation) wireless network, including 5G from space satellites. 5G will massively increase exposure to radio frequency (RF) radiation on top of the 2G, 3G and 4G networks for telecommunications already in place. RF radiation has been proven harmful for humans and the environment. The deployment of 5G constitutes an experiment on humanity and the environment that is defined as a crime under international law.
Executive summary
Telecommunications companies worldwide, with the support of governments, are poised within the next two years to roll out the fifth-generation wireless network (5G). This is set to deliver what is acknowledged to be unprecedented societal change on a global scale. We will have “smart” homes, “smart” businesses, “smart” highways, “smart” cities and self-driving cars. Virtually everything we own and buy, from refrigerators and washing machines to milk cartons, hairbrushes and infants’ diapers, will contain antennas and microchips and will be connected wirelessly to the Internet. Every person on Earth will have instant access to super-high-speed, low- latency wireless communications from any point on the planet, even in rainforests, mid-ocean and the Antarctic.
What is not widely acknowledged is that this will also result in unprecedented environmental change on a global scale. The planned density of radio frequency transmitters is impossible to envisage. In addition to millions of new 5G base stations on Earth and 20,000 new satellites in space, 200 billion transmitting objects, according to estimates, will be part of the Internet of Things by 2020, and one trillion objects a few years later. Commercial 5G at lower frequencies and slower speeds was deployed in Qatar, Finland and Estonia in mid-2018. The rollout of 5G at extremely high (millimetre wave) frequencies is planned to begin at the end of 2018.
Despite widespread denial, the evidence that radio frequency (RF) radiation is harmful to life is already overwhelming. The accumulated clinical evidence of sick and injured human beings, experimental evidence of damage to DNA, cells and organ systems in a wide variety of plants and animals, and epidemiological evidence that the major diseases of modern civilization—cancer, heart disease and diabetes—are in large part caused by electromagnetic pollution, forms a literature base of well over 10,000 peer-reviewed studies.
If the telecommunications industry’s plans for 5G come to fruition, no person, no animal, no bird, no insect and no plant on Earth will be able to avoid exposure, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to levels of RF radiation that are tens to hundreds of times greater than what exists today, without any possibility of escape anywhere on the planet. These 5G plans threaten to provoke serious, irreversible effects on humans and permanent damage to all of the Earth’s ecosystems.
Immediate measures must be taken to protect humanity and the environment, in accordance with ethical imperatives and international agreements.
5G will result in a massive increase in inescapable, involuntary exposure to wireless radiation
Ground-based 5G
In order to transmit the enormous amounts of data required for the Internet of Things (IoT), 5G technology, when fully deployed, will use millimetre waves, which are poorly transmitted through solid material. This will require every carrier to install base stations every 100 metres[1] in every urban area in the world. Unlike previous generations of wireless technology, in which a single antenna broadcasts over a wide area, 5G base stations and 5G devices will have multiple antennas arranged in “phased arrays” [2],[3] that work together to emit focused, steerable, laser-like beams that track each other.
Each 5G phone will contain dozens of tiny antennas, all working together to track and aim a narrowly focused beam at the nearest cell tower. The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has adopted rules [4] permitting the effective power of those beams to be as much as 20 watts, ten times more powerful than the levels permitted for current phones.
Each 5G base station will contain hundreds or thousands of antennas aiming multiple laser-like beams simultaneously at all cell phones and user devices in its service area. This technology is called “multiple input multiple output” or MIMO. FCC rules permit the effective radiated power of a 5G base station’s beams to be as much as 30,000 watts per 100 MHz of spectrum,[2] or equivalently 300,000 watts per GHz of spectrum, tens to hundreds of times more powerful than the levels permitted for current base stations.
Space-based 5G
At least five companies[5] are proposing to provide 5G from space from a combined 20,000 satellites in low- and medium-Earth orbit that will blanket the Earth with powerful, focused, steerable beams. Each satellite will emit millimetre waves with an effective radiated power of up to 5 million watts[6] from thousands of antennas arranged in a phased array. Although the energy reaching the ground from satellites will be less than that from ground-based antennas, it will irradiate areas of the Earth not reached by other transmitters and will be additional to ground-based 5G transmissions from billions of IoT objects. Even more importantly, the satellites will be located in the Earth’s magnetosphere, which exerts a significant influence over the electrical properties of the atmosphere. The alteration of the Earth’s electromagnetic environment may be an even greater threat to life than the radiation from ground-based antennas (see below).
Harmful effects of radio frequency radiation are already proven
Even before 5G was proposed, dozens of petitions and appeals[7] by international scientists, including the Freiburger Appeal signed by over 3,000 physicians, called for a halt to the expansion of wireless technology and a moratorium on new base stations.[8]
In 2015, 215 scientists from 41 countries communicated their alarm to the United Nations (UN) and World Health Organization (WHO).[9] They stated that “numerous recent scientific publications have shown that EMF [electromagnetic fields] affects living organisms at levels well below most international and national guidelines”. More than 10,000 peer-reviewed scientific studies demonstrate harm to human health from RF radiation.[10] [11] Effects include:
	•	Alteration of heart rhythm[12]
	•	Altered gene expression[13]
	•	Altered metabolism[14]
	•	Altered stem cell development[15]
	•	Cancers[16]
	•	Cardiovascular disease[17]
	•	Cognitive impairment[18]
	•	DNA damage[19]
	•	Impacts on general well-being[20]
	•	Increased free radicals[21]
	•	Learning and memory deficits[22]
	•	Impaired sperm function and quality[23]
	•	Miscarriage[24]
	•	Neurological damage[25]
	•	Obesity and diabetes[26]
	•	Oxidative stress[27]
Effects in children include autism,[28] attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)[29][30] and asthma.[31]
Damage goes well beyond the human race, as there is abundant evidence of harm to diverse plant- and wildlife[32][33] and laboratory animals, including:
	•	Ants[34]
	•	Birds[35][36]
	•	Forests[37]
	•	Frogs[38]
	•	Fruit flies[39]
	•	Honey bees[40]
	•	Insects[41]
	•	Mammals[42]
	•	Mice[43][44]
	•	Plants[45]
	•	Rats[46]
	•	Trees[47]
Negative microbiological effects[48] have also been recorded.
The WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) concluded in 2011 that RF radiation of frequencies 30 kHz - 300 GHz are possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B).[49] However, recent evidence, including the latest studies on cell phone use and brain cancer risks, indicate that RF radiation is proven carcinogenic to humans[50] and should now be classified as a “Group 1 carcinogen” along with tobacco smoke and asbestos.
Most contemporary wireless signals are pulse-modulated. Harm is caused by both the high-frequency carrier wave and the low-frequency pulsations.[51]
The deployment of 5G satellites must be prohibited
The Earth, the ionosphere and the lower atmosphere form the global electric circuit[52] in which we live. It is well established that biological rhythms—of humans,[53][54] birds,[55] hamsters,[56] and spiders[57][58]—are controlled by the Earth’s natural electromagnetic environment and that the well-being of all organisms depends on the stability of this environment, including the electrical properties of the atmosphere.[59][60][61][62] Cherry, in a groundbreaking paper, [63] explained the importance of the Schumann resonances[64] and why ionospheric disturbances can alter blood pressure and melatonin and cause “cancer, reproductive, cardiac and neurological disease and death”.
These elements of our electromagnetic environment have already been altered by radiation from power lines. Power line harmonic radiation[65] reaches the Earth’s ionosphere and magnetosphere, where it is amplified by wave-particle interactions.[66][67] In 1985, Dr. Robert O. Becker warned that power line harmonic radiation had already changed the structure of the magnetosphere, and that the continued expansion of this effect “threatens the viability of all life on Earth”.[68] The placement of tens of thousands of satellites directly in both the ionosphere and magnetosphere, emitting modulated signals at millions of watts and millions of frequencies, is likely to alter our electromagnetic environment beyond our ability to adapt.[69]
Informal monitoring has already provided evidence indicating serious effects on humans and animals from the approximately 100 satellites that have provided 2G and 3G phone service from low orbit since 1998. Such effects cannot be understood only from consideration of the low levels of radiation on the ground. Knowledge from other relevant scientific disciplines must be taken into account, including the fields of atmospheric physics and acupuncture.[70][71][72][73] Adding 20,000 5G satellites will further pollute the global electric circuit[74][75] and could alter the Schumann resonances,[76] with which all life on Earth has evolved. The effects will be universal and may be profoundly damaging.
5G is qualitatively and quantitatively different from 4G
The idea that we will tolerate tens to hundreds of times more radiation at millimetre wavelengths is based on faulty modelling of the human body as a shell filled with a homogeneous liquid.[77][78] The assumption that millimetre waves do not penetrate beyond the skin completely ignores nerves,[79] blood vessels[80][81] and other electrically conducting structures that can carry radiation-induced currents deep into the body.[82][83][84] Another, potentially more serious error is that phased arrays are not ordinary antennas. When an ordinary electromagnetic field enters the body, it causes charges to move and currents to flow. But when extremely short electromagnetic pulses enter the body, something else happens: the moving charges themselves become little antennas that reradiate the electromagnetic field and send it deeper into the body. These reradiated waves are called Brillouin precursors.[85] They become significant when either the power or the phase of the waves changes rapidly enough.[86] 5G will probably satisfy both criteria.
In addition, shallow penetration in itself poses a unique danger to eyes and to the largest organ of the body, the skin, as well as to very small creatures. Peer-reviewed studies have recently been published, predicting thermal skin burns[87] in humans from 5G radiation and resonant absorption by insects,[88] which absorb up to 100 times as much radiation at millimetre wavelengths as they do at wavelengths presently in use. Since populations of flying insects have declined by 75-80 per cent since 1989 even in protected nature areas,[89] 5G radiation could have catastrophic effects on insect populations worldwide. A 1986 study by Om Gandhi warned that millimetre waves are strongly absorbed by the cornea of the eye, and that ordinary clothing, being of millimetre-size thickness, increases the absorption of energy by the skin by a resonance-type effect.[90] Russell (2018) reviews the known effects of millimetre waves on skin, eyes (including cataracts), heart rate, immune system and DNA.[91]
Regulators have deliberately excluded the scientific evidence of harm
Stakeholders thus far in the development of 5G have been industry and governments, while renowned international EMF scientists who have documented biological effects on humans, animals, insects and plants, and alarming effects on health and the environment in thousands of peer-reviewed studies have been excluded. The reason for the current inadequate safety guidelines is that conflicts of interest of standard-setting bodies “due to their relationships with telecommunications or electric companies undermine the impartiality that should govern the regulation of Public Exposure Standards for non-ionizing radiation”. [92] Professor Emeritus Martin L. Pall lays out the conflicts of interest in detail, and the lists of important studies that have been excluded, in his literature review. [93]
The thermal hypothesis is obsolete—new safety standards are needed
Current safety guidelines are based on the obsolete hypothesis that heating is the only harmful effect of EMFs. As Markov and Grigoriev have stated, “Today standards do not consider the real pollution of the environment with nonionizing radiation”.[94] Hundreds of scientists, including many signatories to this appeal, have proven that many different kinds of acute and chronic illnesses and injuries are caused without heating (“non-thermal effect”) from radiation levels far below international guidelines.9 Biological effects occur even at near-zero power levels. Effects that have been found at 0.02 picowatts (trillionths of a watt) per square centimetre or less include altered genetic structure in E. coli[95] and in rats,[96] altered EEG in humans,[97] growth stimulation in bean plants,[98] and stimulation of ovulation in chickens.[99]
To protect against non-thermal effects, duration of exposure must be considered. 5G will expose everyone to many more transmissions simultaneously and continuously, day and night without cessation. New safety standards are needed and should be based on cumulative exposure and not only on power levels but also on frequency, bandwidth, modulation, waveform, pulse width and other properties that are biologically important. Antennas must be confined to specific, publicly identified locations. To protect humans, antennas must be located far from where people live and work, and excluded from the public rights-of-way where people walk. To protect wildlife, they must be excluded from wilderness sanctuaries and strictly minimized in remote areas of the Earth. To protect all life, commercial communications satellites must be limited in number and prohibited in low- and medium-Earth orbits. Phased arrays must be prohibited on Earth and in space.
RF radiation has both acute and chronic effects
RF radiation has both immediate and long-term effects. Cancer and heart disease are examples of long-term effects. Alteration of heart rhythm[100] and changes in brain function (EEG)[101] are examples of immediate effects. A syndrome that was called radiowave sickness[102] in the former Soviet Union and is called electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS) around the world today[103] can be either acute or chronic. Professor Dr. Karl Hecht has published a detailed history of these syndromes, compiled from a review of more than 1,500 Russian scientific papers and the clinical histories of more than 1,000 of his own patients in Germany. Objective findings include sleep disorders, abnormal blood pressure and heart rate, digestive disorders, hair loss, tinnitus and skin rash. Subjective symptoms include dizziness, nausea, headache, memory loss, inability to concentrate, fatigue, flu-like symptoms and cardiac pain. [104]
The EUROPAEM EMF Guideline 2016 states that EHS develops when people are “continuously exposed in their daily life” to increasing levels of EMFs, and that “reduction and prevention of EMF exposure” is necessary to restore these patients to health.[105] EHS should no longer be considered a disease, but an injury by a toxic environment that affects an increasingly large portion of the population, estimated already at 100 million people worldwide,[106][107] and that may soon affect everyone[108] if the worldwide rollout of 5G is permitted.
The International Scientific Declaration on EHS and multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS), Brussels, declared in 2015 that “[i]naction is a cost to society and is not an option any more… [W]e unanimously acknowledge this serious hazard to public health… [urgently requiring] that major primary prevention measures are adopted and prioritized, to face this worldwide pan-epidemic in perspective” (emphasis added).[109]
World governments are failing in their duty of care to the populations they govern
In their haste to implement 5G and to encourage the unconstrained use of outer space, the European Union, United States and national governments worldwide are taking steps to ensure a “barrier-free” regulatory environment.[110] They are prohibiting local authorities from enforcing environmental laws,[111] and “in the interest of speedy and cost-effective deployment”, removing “unnecessary burdens… such as local planning procedures [and] the variety of specific limits on electromagnetic field (EMF) emissions and of the methods required to aggregate them”.[112]
Governments are also enacting laws to make wireless facilities a permitted use in all public rights-of-way.[113] To date, most wireless facilities have been located on private property at some distance from homes and businesses. In order for them to be spaced less than 100 metres apart as required by 5G, however, they will now be located on the sidewalk directly in front of homes and businesses and close above the heads of pedestrians, including mothers with babies.
Public notice requirements and public hearings are being eliminated. Even if there were a hearing and 100 scientific experts were to testify against 5G, laws have been passed making it illegal for local authorities to take their testimony into consideration. US law, for example, prohibits local governments from regulating wireless technology “on the basis of the environmental effects of radio frequency radiation”,[114] and courts have reversed regulatory decisions about cell tower placement simply because most of the public testimony was about health.[115] Insurers will not provide coverage against EMF risks,[116] and there is zero clarity as to what entity will bear legal responsibility for damage to life, limb and property arising from exposure to 5G, whether ground- or space-based.[117]
In the absence of an agreed comprehensive legal regime governing activities in outer space, legal liability for those activities is non-existent, despite the prospect of whole continents, the atmosphere and the oceans being put at risk by them.
 International agreements are being violated
Children and duty of care
The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child: States shall “undertake to ensure the child such protection and care as is necessary for his or her well-being” (art. 3), “ensure… the survival and development of the child” (art. 6) and “take appropriate measures to combat disease… taking into consideration the dangers and risks of environmental pollution” (art. 24(c)).
The Nuremberg Code (1947) applies to all experiments on humans, thus including the deployment of 5G with new, higher RF radiation exposure that has not been pre-market tested for safety. “The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential” (art. 1). Exposure to 5G will be involuntary. “No experiment should be conducted, where there is an a priori reason to believe that death or disabling injury will occur” (art. 5). The findings of over 10,000 scientific studies and the voices of hundreds of international organizations representing hundreds of thousands of members who have suffered disabling injury and been displaced from their homes by already-existing wireless telecommunications facilities, are “a priori reasons to believe that death or disabling injury will occur”.
Duty to inform and EMFs
The World Telecommunication Standardization Assembly (2012) of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) stated that “[t]here is a need to inform the public of the potential effects of exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMFs)” and invited Member States “to adopt suitable measures in order to ensure compliance with relevant international recommendations to protect health against the adverse effect of EMF”.
The Mid-term review of the European Environment and Health Action Plan 2004-2010 (2008): “The European Parliament… [n]otes that the limits on exposure to electromagnetic fields which have been set for the general public are obsolete, … obviously take no account of developments in information and communication technologies, of the recommendations issued by the European Environment Agency or of the stricter emission standards adopted, for example, by Belgium, Italy and Austria, and do not address the issue of vulnerable groups, such as pregnant women, newborn babies and children.”
Resolution 1815 (Council of Europe, 2011): “Take all reasonable measures to reduce exposure to electromagnetic fields, especially to radio frequencies from mobile phones, and particularly the exposure to children and young people.”
Environment
The Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (1972): “The discharge of toxic substances… in such quantities or concentrations as to exceed the capacity of the environment to render them harmless, must be halted in order to ensure that serious or irreversible damage is not inflicted upon ecosystems” (principle 6).
The World Charter for Nature (1982): “Activities which are likely to cause irreversible damage to nature shall be avoided… [W]here potential adverse effects are not fully understood, the activities should not proceed” (art. 11).
The Rio Declaration on Environment and Development (1992): “States have… the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction” (principle 2).
The United Nations World Summit on Sustainable Development (2002): “There is an urgent need to… create more effective national and regional policy responses to environmental threats to human health” (para. 54(k)).
The African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (2017): “The Parties shall… take all appropriate measures to prevent, mitigate and eliminate to the maximum extent possible, detrimental effects on the environment, in particular from radioactive, toxic, and other hazardous substances and wastes” (art. 13).
Health and human rights
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948): “Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person” (art. 3).
The United Nations Global Strategy for Women’s, Children’s and Adolescents’ Health (2016-2030) has as objectives and targets to “transform”, by expanding enabling environments; to “survive”, by reducing maternal and newborn mortality; and to “thrive” by ensuring health and well-being and reducing pollution-related deaths and illnesses.
Space
The Outer Space Treaty (1967) requires that the use of outer space be conducted “so as to avoid [its] harmful contamination and also adverse changes in the environment of the Earth” (art. IX)
The United Nations Guidelines for The Long-Term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities (2018): “States and international intergovernmental organizations should address… risks to people, property, public health and the environment associated with the launch, in-orbit operation and re-entry of space objects” (guideline 2.2(c)).
World governments are playing dice with life on Earth
Albert Einstein famously asserted that “God does not play dice”.[118] Yet by pursuing the broadcast on Earth and from space of 5G, an unprecedented technology of millimetre waves previously used as an energy weapon in military operations and crowd control,[119] world governments are recklessly playing dice with the future of life on Earth.
To refuse to accept and apply relevant and valid scientific knowledge is ethically unacceptable. Existing research shows that 5G—and especially space-based 5G—contravenes principles enshrined in a host of international agreements.
We call upon the UN, WHO, EU, Council of Europe and governments of all nations,
(a) To take immediate measures to halt the deployment of 5G on Earth and in space in order to protect all humankind, especially the unborn, infants, children, adolescents and pregnant women, as well as the environment;
(b) To follow the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and Council of Europe Resolution 1815 by informing citizens, including teachers and physicians, about the health risks (to adults and children) from RF radiation, and why they should and how they can avoid wireless communication and base stations, particularly in or near day-care centres, schools, hospitals, homes and workplaces;
(c) To favour and implement wired telecommunications instead of wireless;
(d) To prohibit the wireless/telecommunications industry through its lobbying organizations from persuading officials to make decisions permitting further expansion of RF radiation, including ground- and space-based 5G;
(e) To appoint immediately—without industry influence—international groups of independent, truly impartial EMF and health scientists with no conflicts of interest, [120] for the purpose of establishing new international safety standards for RF radiation that are not based only on power levels, that consider cumulative exposure, and that protect against all health and environmental effects, not just thermal effects and not just effects on humans;
(f) To appoint immediately—without industry influence—international groups of scientists with expertise in EMFs, health, biology and atmospheric physics, for the purpose of developing a comprehensive regulatory framework that will ensure that the uses of outer space are safe for humans and the environment, taking into account RF radiation, rocket exhaust gases, black soot, and space debris and their impacts on ozone, [121] global warming, [122] the atmosphere and the preservation of life on Earth. Not only ground-based but also space-based technology must be sustainable [123] for adults and children, animals and plants.
