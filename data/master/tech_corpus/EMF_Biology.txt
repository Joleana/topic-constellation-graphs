Electric and magnetic senses in marine animals, and potential behavioral effects of\
electromagnetic surveys\
\
Abstract\
11 Electromagnetic surveys generate electromagnetic fields to map petroleum deposits under the\
12 seabed with unknown consequences for marine animals. The electric and magnetic fields\
13 induced by electromagnetic surveys can be detected by many marine animals, and the\
14 generated fields may potentially affect the behavior of perceptive animals. Animals using\
15 magnetic cues for migration or local orientation, especially during a restricted time-window,\
16 risk being affected by electromagnetic surveys. In electrosensitive animals, anthropogenic\
17 electric fields could disrupt a range of behaviors. The lack of studies on effects of the\
18 electromagnetic fields induced by electromagnetic surveys on the behavior of magneto- and\
19 electrosensitive animals is a reason for concern. Here, we review the use of electric and\
20 magnetic fields among marine animals, present data on survey generated and natural\
21 electromagnetic fields, and discuss potential effects of electromagnetic surveys on the\
22 behavior of marine animals.\

Commercially deployed since the beginning of the 21th 27 century, electromagnetic techniques\
28 (controlled-source electromagnetic sounding, seabed logging, remote reservoir resistivity\
29 mapping) have become a common tool in oil exploration. With this technique, electric and\
30 magnetic fields are generated to map petroleum deposits under the sea bed (Constable 2006).\
31 Many marine animals, however, use electric and/or magnetic fields for orientation and\
32 migration, and \'96 as sharks and rays - even for communication, prey detection, and predator\
33 avoidance (Collin and Whitehead 2004, Kalmijn 1982, Kullnick 2000). Thus, exposure to\
34 electromagnetic surveys may disrupt a wide range of animal behaviors. Between 2009 and\
35 2018, 149 surveys, extending over 4238 days were conducted in Norwegian waters alone\
36 (OD 2019). Despite the widespread use of this technique across the globe, studies on its\
37 impact on aquatic life are virtually absent from the scientific literature (although potential\
38 effects are discussed in industry reports; Buchanan et al. 2006, Buchanan et al. 2011). Here\
39 we review the use of electric and magnetic fields among marine animals and discuss potential\
40 effects of electromagnetic surveys on the animal\'92s behavior.\
41 1. Electromagnetic surveys\
42 In typical electromagnetic surveys, an electromagnetic source is towed about 30-50 m above\
43 the bottom or 10 m under the surface, at a speed of a few meters per second (Buchanan et al.\
44 2006, Buchanan et al. 2011, Key et al. 2012). In another type of system (vertical surveys), the\
45 source is placed perpendicular to the sea bottom for an hour, at consecutive stationary\
46 positions distributed over the survey area (Ellingsrud and Larsen 2019, Helwig et al 2019).\
47 The source produces an alternating electromagnetic field (0.05-10 Hz) which propagates\
48 through the water mass and the seabed and is modified by the conductivity of the media it\
49 passes through. An array of sensors anchored on the sea bed 0.5 \'96 3 km apart detect the\
50 modified electromagnetic signals and their characteristics are used to model petroleum\
51 deposits in the ground (Buchanan et al. 2006, Buchanan et al. 2011, Holten et al. 2009,\
52 Johnsson and Oftedal 2011, Key et al 2012). While surveys used to be restricted to deep\
53 waters, far from the surface, they are now also taking place over relatively shallow depths.\
54 Surface tows are conducted over depths down to 500 m, deep tows are performed at depths\
55 down to 3500 m, and vertical stationary surveys in waters from 100 to 1200 m deep.\
56 (Buchanan et al. 2011, Ellingsrud and Larsen 2019, Mittet 2016, Mittet and Jensen 2018).\
57 The reported maximum electric and magnetic field strengths are 0.5-6 V/cm and 200 000 nT\
58 respectively, but both attenuate rapidly with distance (Fig. 1-2; Ellingsrud 2014, Johnsson\
59 and Oftedal 2011, Mittet 2016, Mittet and Jensen 2018). According to Buchanan (2011), the\
60 magnetic field is below 200 nT at 400 m distance, and the electric field under 400 nV/cm at\
61 1000-1900 m distance. Mittet and Jensen (2018) report levels at distances in similar order of\
62 magnitudes (up to 600 nV/cm and 48 nT at 1000 m distance). \

81 2. Electromagnetic fields in nature\
82 In systems in movement, electric and magnetic fields occur together. An electric field is\
83 induced in any conductor that is moving through a magnetic field or that is exposed to a\
84 changing magnetic field. An electric current in a conductor creates a magnetic field in the\
85 space surrounding the conductor (Young and Freedman 1996). Magnetic and electric fields\
86 are part of the environment of practically every living organism (Skiles 1985).\
87 2.1Magnetic fields\
88 The Earth\'92s own magnetic field, the geomagnetic field, is one of the strongest naturally\
89 occurring components of the magnetic field that organisms experience. The Earth\'92s magnetic\
90 field is produced by currents generated by convection of molten iron in the outer core. It has\
91 an inclination and a magnitude (sometimes referred to as intensity) that both vary relatively\
92 predictably with geographic location. The inclination is 0\'b0 at the magnetic equator and 90\'b0 at\
93 the magnetic poles while the magnitude is around 60 000 nT at the poles, 40 000 - 50 000 nT\
94 at mid latitudes, and 30 000 nT at the equator. This results in an average change of 2-5\
95 nT/km, and 0.01\'b0/km between the equator and the poles. In addition, crystal rocks in the crust\
96 and non-dipole components of the core\'92s internal dynamo produce local anomalies, causing\
97 magnetic fields several times weaker or stronger than expected, and gradients of 10-100\
98 nT/km (Kullnick 2000, Skiles 1985, Walker et al. 2003). Also, relevant for life on earth, the\
99 natural geomagnetic field is constantly changing, and has historically even experienced\
100 several pole reversals. Today the total field is changing at a rate of 0 - 120 nT / year\
101 depending on geographic location (British Geological Survey 2018, Skiles 1985).\
102 Solar electromagnetic and particle radiation produces solar-terrestrial interactions that cause\
103 both small and large magnetic disturbances. Solar-terrestrial interactions cause larger\
104 disturbances at higher latitudes, ie. in the auroral zones (the latitudinal bands where northern\
105 and southern lights occur most frequently). Local diurnal changes in magnetic field range\
106 from a few to over 500 nT (UiT 2018; Klinowska 1986, Skiles 1985). Solar storms, on the\
107 other hand, can periodically produce much larger disturbances. The magnitude and frequency\
108 of solar storms follow an 11-year solar cycle with quiet and active times. Minor disturbances,\
109 occurring in auroral zones, of 100-200 nT typically last 30 min to several hours and occur a\
110 few to hundreds of times a year depending on location (Fig. 3-4). Large storms occur more\
111 seldom but can cause disturbances of several 1000 nT, and last for days. Both the occurrence\
112 of minor disturbances and solar storms vary with the solar cycle. (Brittish Geological Survey\
113 2018, Klinowska 1986; Parkinson 1983; Skiles 1985).\

117 interaction generates magnetic disturbances on the ground of more than 100 nT. Northern\
118 latitudes are more regularly exposed to magnetic disturbances, while the occurrence of\
119 disturbances in more southern latitudes are more correlated with the solar cycle (data from\
120 UiT).\

125 The total field variation is calculated by subtracting the Earth's internal field from the\
126 measured total field strength. The internal field is estimated for every ten-day interval by\
127 finding the value of which most of the variations are centered around (using least square\
128 roots). Data from UiT.\
129 2.2 Electric fields\
130 In nature, electric fields are induced in the sea when saltwater, a conductor, moves in the\
131 natural magnetic field, and vary with the magnetic field strength and current speeds. For\
132 example, in the English channel electric fields usually measure 5 - 500 nV/cm (Kalmijn\
133 1999). From the Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf Stream and the North Sea, similar electric field\
134 strengths of 350-500 nV/cm are reported (Buchanan et al. 2011). Magnetic disturbances\
135 induce electric fields both in the atmosphere and in the sea. During magnetic storms, induced\
136 electric fields can reach strengths of 10 000 nV/cm (Kalmijn 1999). Following the same\
137 principle, electric fields are also induced when animals swim in the Earth\'92s magnetic field\
138 (Kalmijn 1999).\
139 Another source of natural electric fields is living organisms. Organisms constantly generate\
140 electric fields during their life processes for example during cell membrane transport, muscle\
141 contractions and nerve cell communication (Crampton 2019). The characteristics of the\
142 generated electric fields depend on the taxa, position and activity of the animal, and typically\
143 range from 2 000 \'96 100 000 nV/cm at a very close distance (Haine et al. 2001). Some fish\
144 also actively produce electricity (Crampton 2019). For example, some skates produce weak\
145 electric signals, presumably for communication, and electric rays hunt by generating electric\
146 discharges (Bratton and Ayers 1987, Bray and Hixon 1978, Lowe et al. 1994).\
147 3. Magnetic fields and marine animals\
148 3.1 Magnetosensitive organisms\
149 Many organisms respond to geomagnetic cues, from bacteria (Frankel and Blakemore 1980)\
150 and protists (Bazylinski et al. 2000) to insects, crustaceans, fish, sea turtles, birds, and\
151 mammals (Wiltschko and Wiltschko 2005). Organisms respond to the direction, magnitude.\
152 or/and inclination of the geomagnetic field. There are three main mechanisms proposed for\
153 magnetoreception: magnetite based magnetoreception, radical-pair mechanisms and electric\
154 field mediated magnetic orientation. In the magnetite based magnetoreception, magnetite\
155 crystal alignment depends on the magnetic field, and is picked up by nerve cells. The radical156 pair mechanism is based on chemical reactions dependent on the magnetic fields, and\
157 possibly coupled to photo excitation. Finally, electric fields are induced when the animal or\
158 saltwater move through the geomagnetic field, and could be used for orientation in\
159 electroreceptive organisms (Gould 2008, Johnsen and Lohmann 2005, Mouritsen 2018,\
160 Rommel and McCleave 1973, Walker et al. 2003). Although much remains to be learned, in\
161 the marine environment fish and turtles likely use a magnetite mechanism while the radical162 pair mechanism has strong support (without excluding a magnetite mechanism) among birds\
163 and some invertebrates (Mouritsen 2018). All three mechanisms are extensively explained in\
164 reviews by Mouritsen (2018) and Johnsen and Lohmann (2005; 2008).\
165 Animals can theoretically use magnetic cues to establish a direction of movement relative to\
166 the magnetic north (compass orientation) or, more complex, to orient on a magnetic map. In\
167 contrast to the establishment of a direction, a magnetic map sense utilizes two magnetic \
8\
168 coordinates such as inclination and magnitude (or one magnetic gradient in combination with\
169 other environmental cues, e.g. stars, the sun, or polarized light) to position the organism in\
170 relation to its environment. A magnetic map sense requires high sensitivity to detect low\
171 gradients, as well as mechanisms to handle local irregularities, solar induced disturbances,\
172 and geomagnetic drift over time. In the marine environment there is, so far, evidence for a\
173 magnetic map sense in turtles, fish, and crustaceans (Mouritsen 2018). Magnetic orientation,\
174 on the other hand, is widespread in the aquatic environment, and has been related to both long\
175 distance migrations and local movements (Johnsen and Lohman 2008). In general, magnetic\
176 cues seem to be used interchangeably, or together with, other environmental cues (Freake et\
177 al. 2006, Muheim et al 2006).\
178 Long distance migrations are common in the marine environment and many migratory\
179 species seem to use magnetic cues for orientation (Putman 2018; Mouritsen 2018). Both\
180 salmons and eels have lifecycles that include long distance migration at sea and respond to\
181 changes in the magnetic field. Among salmonid fish, geomagnetic orientation has been\
182 observed for both juveniles and adults. Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) spawners\
183 deviate their migration route towards the river following the geomagnetic drift (Putman et al.\
184 2013). Further, fry or juveniles of sockeye salmon (Quinn 1980), chum salmon\
185 (Oncorhynchus keta; Quinn and Groot 1983), chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha;\
186 Walker et al. 2003), Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar; Scanlan et al. 2018);brown trout (Salmo\
187 trutta; Formicki et al. 2002) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss; Chew and Brown\
188 1989, Putman et al. 2014) - all migratory salmonid species - orient to manipulated magnetic\
189 fields. In experimental settings, European eels (Anguilla anguilla) and Japanese eels\
190 (Anguilla japonica) have responded to or oriented in relation to magnetic fields, indicating\
191 the possible use of a magnetic sense during marine migrations (Cresci et al. 2017, Durif et al.\
192 2013, Nishi and Kawamura 2005, Nishi et al. 2004). Also yellowfin tuna (Thunnus\
193 albacares), another fish performing long distance migrations, have, in captivity,\
194 demonstrated the ability to discriminate shifts in the magnetic field direction in a training\
195 experiment (Walker 1984). Among displaced green turtles (Chelonia mydas), magnetically\
196 manipulated individuals displayed longer homing paths compared to control animals,\
197 indicating that a magnetic sense facilitates homing (Luschi et al. 2007).\
198\
199 Elasmobranchs potentially use their electroreception and electric induction to sense magnetic\
200 fields (Molteno and Kennedy 2009). In directed movements, hammerhead sharks are\
201 hypothesized to orient in association with high magnitude magnetic slopes (Klimley 1993),\
202 and, similarly, several species of sharks swimming in straight lines for long periods of time\
203 are thought to do so using geomagnetic cues (Meyer et al. 2005). Indeed, in captivity,\
204 hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini) and sandbar sharks (Carcharhinus plumbeus) perceived the\
205 magnetic field in a conditioning experiment. The sharks were trained to respond to an\
206 artificial magnetic field by being presented food when this field was turned on (Meyer et al.\
207 2005). Also captive stingrays (Dasyatis brevicaudata) have been able to discriminate between\
208 presence and absence of magnetic anomalies in training experiments (Walker et al. 2003). It\
209 cannot, however, be excluded that these elasmobranchs reacted to the electric field in the\
210 experimental coil rather than to the magnetic field (Johnsen and Lohmann 2005).\
211 \
9\
212 Cetaceans (whales and dolphins) have also been hypothesized to navigate using geomagnetic\
213 cues during their migrations. In line with this, sighting positions of fin whales (Belaenoptera\
214 physalus) of northeastern United States correlated with areas of low geomagnetic magnitude\
215 during migration, but not with bathymetric parameters, indicating the use of geomagnetic\
216 cues rather than bathymetric features for navigation (Walker et al. 1992). In captivity,\
217 bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncates), approached a magnetic object faster than to an\
218 identical non-magnetic object, indicating a magnetic sense (Kremers et al. 2014).\
219\
220 Magnetic cues can also be used to keep relatively weak swimming animals in suitable ocean\
221 currents, or in relation to movements to or away from the shore. Larvae of juvenile\
222 loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) presented with inclinations and intensities from different\
223 locations oriented in directions that would keep them in the North Atlantic gyre, their\
224 preferred feeding area (Lohmann et al. 2001, Lohmann and Lohmann 1996). Also Atlantic\
225 haddock larvae (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) oriented after the magnetic field, both in a\
226 chamber placed in the North Sea and in the laboratory, presumably as a mechanism for\
227 suitable dispersal (Cresci et al. 2019a). Glass eels (juvenile European eels) adjust their\
228 magnetic orientation depending on the tide and the moon phase to find their coastal habitats\
229 (Cresci et al 2017, 2019b, 2019c). In experiments, juvenile loggerhead sea turtles that leave\
230 the shore, swimming against the waves have been reported to use geomagnetic cues to\
231 maintain an off-shore direction after contact with the coast, has been lost (Goff et al. 1998).\
232 Similarly, Antarctic amphipods (Gondogeneia antarctica), brought to a laboratory, moved in\
233 the geomagnetic seaward direction of their home beach (Tomanova and Vacha 2016). Also in\
234 a laboratory, larvae of damselfish (Chromis atripectoralis) and cardinalfish (Ostorhinchus\
235 doederleini), two coral reef fishes, responded to shifts in magnetic field with corresponding\
236 shifts in orientation, demonstrating magnetic compass orientation and its potential use in\
237 homing or reef settlement (Bottesch et al. 2016, O'Connor and Muheim 2017).\
238 At least some marine animals use the geomagnetic field for relatively local orientation. Spiny\
239 lobsters (Panulirus argus), for example, are capable of detecting changes and orienting in the\
240 magnetic field, and also have a magnetic map sense to guide their local movements (Boles\
241 and Lohmann 2003, Lohmann et al. 1995).\
242 In general, our understanding of the use of magnetic cues among animals is limited, and its\
243 occurrence is likely more widespread than what is documented. For example, among marine\
244 invertebrates, sea slugs (Nudibranchia) orient relative to geomagnetic compass directions\
245 (Lohmann and Willows 1987) and several additional crustaceans are believed to use a\
246 magnetic compass (Kullnick 2000).\
247 3.2 Magnetic disturbances and animal behavior\
248 As discussed above, geomagnetic disturbances of different sizes are naturally recurrent, and\
249 correlate with changes in the movement pattern of both marine mammals and fish.\
250 Associations between live whale strandings and natural geomagnetic disturbances have been\
251 observed around the world (Ferrari 2017, Kirschvink et al. 1986, Klinowska 1986). Stranding\
252 locations of whales were associated with magnetic field anomalies of less than 50 nT\
253 (Kirschvink et al. 1986). Also, a publication in Russian reports a correlation between the\
254 level of geomagnetic activity and catches of herring. Herring supposedly migrated from \
10\
255 shallow areas in the Barents Sea to deep waters of the Norwegian Sea during larger magnetic\
256 storms (references in Krylov et al. 2014).\
257 Artificial displacement experiments can be used to infer changes of the magnetic field that\
258 may result in a changed orientation of groups of animals. In this kind of experiments, the\
259 magnetic field is manipulated by a coil system and the average orientation of animals are\
260 tested under different magnetic field conditions and in the absence of other orientational cues.\
261 In such experiments, Atlantic salmon showed distinct magnetic orientation from changes as\
262 small as 3400 nT and 6.4\'b0 (Scanlan et al. 2019), while spiny lobsters and loggerhead turtles\
263 both displayed distinct average orientation from artificial displacements around 5000 nT and\
264 8\'b0 (Boles and Lohmann 2003, Fuxjager et al. 2011). Rainbow trout oriented in different\
265 direction from a displacement of 11 000 nT and 17\'b0 (Putman et al. 2014). The magnetic field\
266 differences that result in the animals changing orientation might indicate a size of disturbance\
267 that might cause an orientation effect in exposed animals. These levels, however, in addition\
268 to not being lower thresholds for inducing change, will in nature likely be modulated by other\
269 orientation cues (Freake et al. 2006, Muheim et al 2006, Mouritsen 2018)\
270\
271 Under water electrical cables cause local deviation from the natural geomagnetic field\
272 (Taormina et al. 2018). In the Baltic sea, migrating European eels passing over an electric\
273 cable, inducing magnetic field strengths of 5000 nT at 60 m distance, deviated from their\
274 migration route, but resumed their migration direction after only a short average delay of 30\
275 minutes (Westerberg and Begout-Anras 2000, \'d6hman et al. 2007). In an enclosure\
276 experiment, little skate (Leucoraja erinacea) reduced speed, and increased distance, travel\
277 speed and frequency of turns \'96 consistent with increased exploration or feeding behavior -\
278 when exposed to electromagnetic fields from an underwater cable. In this experiment the\
279 animals experienced magnetic fields strengths of 51 600 \'96 65 300 nT, or deviations from the\
280 natural field of 300 \'96 14 000 nT (Hutchison et al. 2018). In another experiment, edible crab\
281 (Cancer pagaurus) exposed to 2 800 000 \'96 40 000 000 nT for 24 h displayed increased\
282 sheltering and a preference for magnetically exposed shelters (Scott et al. 2018). However, no\
283 effects were found on the shelter seeking behavior of juvenile lobsters (Homarus gammarus)\
284 exposed to artificial magnetic field of a maximum intensity of 200 000 nT (Taormina et al.\
285 2020).\
286 Additionally, magnets have been used experimentally to modify fish behavior, for example to\
287 divert or attract certain species from/to fishing gears. Strong magnets have been used, with\
288 mixed results, to reduce shark bycatch in baited fisheries (Hart and Collin 2015, Porsmoguer\
289 et al. 2015, Richards et al. 2018), and in freshwater, magnets placed at the entrances of fyke290 nets increased catches of perch (Perca fluviatilis), roach (Rutilus rutilus), rudd (Scardinius\
291 erythrophthalmus), and bleak (Alburnus sp.) (Formicki et al. 2004). In a behavioral choice\
292 experiment, magnets placed at artificial dens resulted in fewer sheltering spiny lobsters\
293 compared to controls, indicating that anthropogenic magnetic anomalies might influence\
294 local movement in natural environments (Ernst and Lohmann 2016)\
295 Few studies are available on magnetic field thresholds perceived or susceptible of inducing a\
296 behavioral change in marine animals (But see table 1). Rainbow trout, in a heartbeat\
297 conditioning experiment, perceived magnetic field changes over 30 000 nT and 10\'b0\
298 (Hellinger and Hoffmann 2009) and Japanese eels exhibited a response to 12 000 nT (Nishi et \
11\
299 al. 2004). However, similar to the elasmobranch experiments referred to above, in these\
300 studies the experimental design did not allow to discriminate whether the animals responded\
301 to the magnetic field or changing electrical fields. As mentioned previously, in moving or\
302 changing systems the magnetic and electric fields occur together. This means that from a\
303 moving animal\'92s perspective, or for an animal experiencing changing fields, the organism is\
304 simultaneously exposed to both magnetic and electric fields. Depending on the animal\'92s\
305 perceptive ability, it could, in theory, sense neither, one, or both fields (Skiles 1985). This\
306 should be kept in mind here, and throughout the text when the use of separate electric and\
307 magnetic fields is discussed. It should also be noted that some experimental designs do allow\
308 the discrimination of non-magnetic effects: for example, systems that use doubled-wrapped\
309 coil systems with electricity running in antiparallel directions will cancel out the electric field\
310 (Kirschvink 1992).\
311 As discussed above, organisms may respond to the direction and/or to the magnitude of the\
312 geomagnetic field. That is, they may orient along a simple compass direction, but they may\
313 also navigate using a \'91magnetic map\'92 based on the intensity and the inclination of the field\
314 (Johnsen and Lohmann 2005; Mouritsen 2018). Although little explored, this means that the\
315 geometry of the magnetic disturbance compared to the ambient geomagnetic field is likely\
316 important when evaluating its effect. Thus, the severity of a disturbance could vary between\
317 species that utilize different components of the magnetic field. For instance, if an organism\
318 senses direction in the horizontal plane, like a two-dimensional compass, then the horizontal\
319 component of the disturbance is key. It will be different for organisms sensing the vertical\
320 component or the inclination. The impact of the disturbance will also vary depending on its\
321 geometry, where both size and direction of the disturbance field compared to the ambient\
322 field will matter. A disturbance might also have greater effects on the inclination than on the\
323 total intensity, or vice versa. A compass sense might be affected differently than a map sense,\
324 or effects might differ if the map sense is fitted for local rather than long distance orientation\
325 (Johnsen and Lohmann 2005; Mouritsen 2018). Also, the physiological mechanisms by\
326 which an animal senses the magnetic field may modulate effects of anthropogenic\
327 disturbances. For example, strong and short electromagnetic pulses have been used to disable\
328 supposed magnetite based magnetic senses, while radiofrequency electromagnetic fields seem\
329 to immobilize the radical-pair mechanism (Johnsen and Lohman 2005; Mouritsen 2018).\
330 Hence, when assessing the impact of anthropogenic activity, it may be important to consider\
331 the particular way animals sense the field as well as the direction of the anthropogenic field\
332 compared to the ambient field.\
333 Exposures to relatively high strength magnetic fields for days to weeks can have\
334 physiological effects on organisms. Formicki et al. (2019) reviewed effects on spermatozoa\
335 movement, fertilization rates, and egg incubation period in a range of fish species, and\
336 Juutilainen (2005) reports developmental effects in fish and sea urchin embryos from\
337 exposure to magnetic fields in the range of 0.1-10 mT. In addition, natural diurnal weak\
338 magnetic field variation could play a role in organisms\'92 internal clocks, and magnetic\
339 disturbances may hence be able to cause chronobiological disruptions, with potential health\
340 consequences for the organism (Liboff 2014) and effects of anthropogenic magnetic fields on\
341 homeostatic and metabolic functions have been suggested (Begall et al. 2013). Also, distorted\
342 magnetic fields during developmental phases have resulted in failed magnetic orientation\
343 later in life, perhaps by effects on an internal magnetic map, in loggerhead sea turtles and \
12\
344 rainbow trout (Fuxjager et al 2014, Putman et al. 2014). However, such long-term exposure\
345 effects are likely not relevant in the context of electromagnetic surveys which only disturb\
346 animals for a short period (minutes to hours).\
347\
348 4. Electric fields and marine animals\
349 4.1 Electrosensitive organisms\
350 Although all animals use electricity during their life-processes, some animals have also\
351 evolved to detect weak electric fields in their environment (Crampton 2019). Elasmobranchs\
352 detect very weak electric fields as the potential difference between the center of their body\
353 and their outer skin, across membranes lining sensory organs called Ampullae of Lorenzini.\
354 Ampullae are scattered over the head in sharks, and over the head and pectoral fins in skates\
355 and rays. Uneven stimulation of these ampullae enables detection of spatial location and\
356 direction of electrical sources. (Adair et al. 1998, Collin and Whitehead 2004). Among\
357 marine fish, specialized electroreception is also present among lampreys\
358 (Petromyzontiformes), stargazers (Uranoscopidae), sturgeons (Acipenseridae), catfishes\
359 (Siluriformes) and coelacanths (Latimeriidae) (AlvesGomes 2001, Collin and Whitehead\
360 2004, Walker 2001). In freshwater, paddle fish (Polydon spathula), lungfishes (Dipnoi),\
361 bichirfishes, reedfishes (Polypteridae), and weak electric fish (Gymnotiformes and\
362 Mormyridae) perceive weak electric fields (Crampton 2019; Wilkens and Hofmann 2007). In\
363 addition, Atlantic salmon and European eel respond to weak electric fields in the lab\
364 (Rommel Jr and McCleave 1973a). Electroreception has also recently been discovered in\
365 Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis), and its presence in other cetaceans hypothesized\
366 (Czech-Damal et al. 2011).\
367 4.1.1 Predation, predator avoidance, and communication\
368 In elasmobranchs, the electric sense is used for prey detection, predator avoidance,\
369 communication with, and location of, conspecifics, and potentially for geomagnetic\
370 orientation (Bratton and Ayers 1987, Collin and Whitehead 2004). For example, in\
371 experiments, both skates and sharks detected and stroke at a burrowed plaice, as well as\
372 towards electrodes simulating a plaice, but failed to do so in the absence of electrical signals\
373 (Kalmijn 1971, Kalmijn 1982). Also, skate and shark embryos ceased all ventilation when\
374 exposed to electric fields simulating ventilation pulses of a typical predator, presumably to\
375 avoid predation (Kempster et al. 2013, Sisneros et al. 1998). Stingray males can detect buried\
376 females using electric cues, and their sensitivity increases during the reproductive season\
377 (Bodznick et al. 2003, Sisneros et al. 1998, Sisneros and Tricas 2000). Due to the low\
378 strength of bio-generated electrical signals, the detection distance is relatively short, in the\
379 range of 5 - 40 cm (Kalmijn 1971, Kalmijn 1982). There is also tendency for benthic feeding\
380 elasmobranchs to have enhanced electroreception compared to pelagic feeding fish within the\
381 same groups (Collin and Whitehead 2004, Raschi 1986). In freshwater also paddlefish and\
382 weak electric fish locate prey using their electric senses (Wilkens and Hofmann 2007).\
383 4.1.2 Orientation and migration\
384 As mentioned above, electrosensitive animals have been suggested to use their electric sense\
385 to orient according to electric fields induced by the geomagnetic field. In training\
386 experiments, stingrays showed the ability to orient relative to an electric field similar to those \
13\
387 produced by ocean currents (Kalmijn 1982). Among teleosts, Atlantic salmon and American\
388 eel (Anguilla rostrata) showed, in heartbeat conditioning experiments \'96 a training experiment\
389 to test detection ability, consistent cardiac response to weak electric fields. The electric field\
390 strengths were in magnitudes within the range predicted for the Gulf stream, causing\
391 speculation over the potential use of an electric sense in oceanic migration (Rommel Jr and\
392 McCleave 1973a, Rommel Jr and Mccleave 1973b).\
393 4.2 Electric disturbances and animal behavior\
394 There is some knowledge of threshold levels in relation to the electric field. Elasmobranchs\
395 can respond to electric fields of 1 \'96 10 nV/cm, but noise due to the fish moving in the\
396 geomagnetic field might put the practical threshold at 20 nV/cm (Collin and Whitehead 2004,\
397 Peters et al. 2007). Among non-elasmobranch fish, Russian sturgeon (Acipenser\
398 gueldenstaedtii) and sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus) showed behavioral responses to field\
399 strengths of 500 000 nV/cm (Basov 1999) whereas lampreys and eels in the laboratory were\
400 observed to perceive electrical field strengths down to 1000 nV/cm, and 670 nV/cm\
401 respectively (Chung-Davidson et al. 2004, Kullnick 2000, Rommel and McCleave 1972,\
402 Ronan and Bodznick 1986). Lamprey swimming and movement activity was affected\
403 differently by different electric field strengths (Chung-Davidson et al. 2004). In a training\
404 experiment, it was shown that the Guiana dolphin senses electric fields down to 4 600 nV/cm\
405 (Czech-Damal et al. 2011).\
406 An interesting example of effects of electric field disturbance on fish behavior comes from\
407 juvenile paddlefish, a freshwater fish that can locate planktonic prey using their electric sense\
408 at up to 9 cm distance (0.5 to 1 body length for this fish). Paddlefish were observed during\
409 feeding in environments with different levels of anthropogenic electric field intensities. Fields\
410 magnitudes under 100 nV/cm had little effect on the feeding rates, whereas man-made fields\
411 above 1 000 nV/cm limited prey capture to plankton close to the fish\'92s rostrum. At\
412 anthropogenic field intensities at 50 000 nV/cm, feeding nearly stopped (Wilkens et al. 2002).\
413 In addition, paddlefish also reacts to metallic objects, causing electro sensory overload, with\
414 clear avoidance (Wilkens and Hofmann 2007).\
415 Artificial electric fields are used in electrofishing, causing local strong electric fields in the\
416 aquatic environment, followed by strong physio-behavioral effects in nearby animals. At\
417 increasing relatively high electric field strengths fish are first forcibly attracted towards the\
418 positive pole of the electric field (electrotaxis) and then stunned or paralyzed\
419 (electronarcosis) by the electric field (Bary 1956). These phenomena are used to catch fish in\
420 commercial and scientific electro fishing. 3.3 V/cm during 1 second, at 50 Hz is enough to\
421 stun herring. In Atlantic salmon, 2.5 V/cm for 6 - 12 s or 20 V/cm during 0.8 s stuns the fish.\
422 (Nordgreen et al. 2008, Roth et al. 2003, Snyder 2003). The stunning effects of the electric\
423 field on fish increases with fish size; 60 mV/cm is enough to paralyze a 75 cm shark, while at\
424 least 400 mV/cm is required for a 20 cm long mullet (Bary 1956, Smith 1974). Injury rates\
425 also depend on size. In an experiment related to electric trawling, juvenile cod (12 - 16 cm)\
426 survived 2.5-3 V/cm without visible injuries, while larger cod (41 - 55 cm) experienced\
427 vertebrate injuries at 0.4 \'96 1 V/cm (Soetaert et al. 2015). Also invertebrates are fished using\
428 electric fields. Razor clams (Ensis spp.) were stimulated to emerge from the sediment at field\
429 strengths of 0.5 V/cm, while 0.2 \'96 0.4 V/cm during 5 s stimulated Norway lobsters (Nephrops\
430 norvegicus) to emerge from burrows (Soetaert et al. 2015). Electric fields of 40-60 mV/cm (6\
431 Hz) perpendicular to the body elicited a vertical movement response in brown shrimps \
14\
432 (Crangon crangon). Fields parallel to the shrimps orientation resulted in higher thresholds,\
433 and 240 mV/cm elicited responses for all sizes and orientations (Polet et al. 2005).\
434 Electric barriers uses electric fields to deter fish from specific areas (Noatch and Suski 2012).\
435 In waters with high occurrence of shark attacks on humans, electric fields have been used as a\
436 shark deterrent. In an experiment on scalloped hammerhead shark and leopard shark (Triakis\
437 semifasciata) motivated to feed, a mean electric field strength of 410 - 430 mV/cm caused\
438 head twitches in the fish, whereas an electric field strength of 960 - 1850 mV/cm resulted in\
439 the sharks retreating. In this study, the variability in response, however, was relatively high\
440 (Marcotte and Lowe 2008). In another study, based on net catches in relation to the electric\
441 barrier, 30 mV/cm appeared to keep sharks from crossing an electric barrier. Sharks were\
442 observed to approach but then retreat from the electrical barrier. (Smith 1974).\
443 The characteristics of the electric field seem to be important in relation to fish\'92s perceptions\
444 reactions. Elasmobranchs respond to changes in direct electric fields or to low frequency\
445 alternating fields between 0.1 \'96 10 Hz (Bodznick et al. 2003, Collin and Whitehead 2004,\
446 Kalmijn 1999), but this response is thought to be considerably reduced for frequencies above\
447 5 Hz (Adair et al. 1998). Similarly, in freshwater, paddlefish primarily react to electric fields\
448 between 5 \'96 15 Hz, and European eel displayed a 20-fold increase in detection threshold\
449 when frequency was increased from 0.5 Hz to 50 Hz (Berge 1979). In tank experiments,\
450 Russian sturgeon and sterlet showed avoidance or foraging/searching behavior depending on\
451 the frequency with which the electric field alternated (Basov 1999). The directionality of\
452 stationary electric fields also seems to matter, at least for some species and under some\
453 circumstances. For example, American eel, in one heartbeat conditioning experiment,\
454 responded to a lower level when the electric field was applied perpendicular to the body,\
455 compared to when the field was applied in parallel to the fish body (Rommel and McCleave\
456 1972), but European eel, in another experiment, did not (Berge 1979).\
457 5. Effects of electromagnetic surveys on marine life\
458 To our knowledge there are no published studies on effects of electromagnetic surveys on\
459 marine life. There is, nevertheless, as shown above, evidence of the importance of electric\
460 and magnetic cues in nature, some studies on how organisms are affected by specific levels of\
461 electric- or magnet field strengths, and established knowledge on natural variability of\
462 electric and magnetic field strengths.\
463 The effects of electrical or magnetic fields generated by electromagnetic surveys on marine\
464 life likely depend on the strength and direction of the fields, duration of exposure, and\
465 detection capabilities of the animal. In theory, effects could be either physiological, in the\
466 form of injuries or mortality, or through behavioral changes in the animals. Both the electric\
467 and magnetic fields, however, attenuate quickly with distance. The magnetic fields created by\
468 an electromagnetic survey are below the magnitude of the Earth\'92s geomagnetic field at 10 m\
469 from the source, and at the magnitude of relatively frequent geomagnetic storms at a couple\
470 of hundred meter. The electric field associated with these surveys, even at a very short range,\
471 is substantially weaker than what is required to stun fish, or cause sharks to retreat from an\
472 electric barrier (Fig. 2; Marcotte and Lowe 2008, Nordgreen et al. 2008, Roth et al. 2003).\
473 Similarly to the magnetic field, the electric field needs about 500 m to attenuate to natural\
474 oceanic field intensities (Buchanan et al. 2011, Johnsson and Oftedal 2011). Due to this quick\
475 attenuation of the field strengths, any mortality or injury effect that is limited to high fields \
15\
476 strengths would be highly localized and, as the source is continuously moved around, short in\
477 duration. For example, according to an industry report on towed electric magnetic surveys, a\
478 single location along the towing line would be exposed to electric field intensities above 386\
479 nV/cm for 21 min, and magnetic field intensities above 200 nT for only 14 min. (Buchanan\
480 2011). Similarly, in vertical electromagnetic surveys, higher intensities at one point can\
481 persist for an hour before the source is moved. Hence, the risk of direct physical effects from\
482 the induced electric- and magnetic fields should be considered low. Maximum magnetic and\
483 electric field strengths generated by the electromagnetic surveys, however, are several times\
484 larger than the natural geomagnetic and electric fields, and above what causes behavioral\
485 effects in marine animals (Fig. 1-2; Table 1-2). Behavioral effects on magneto- and electro\
486 sensitive animals therefore cannot be excluded.\
487 5.1 Potential behavioral effects of exposure to the magnetic field\
488 As many different organisms perceive changes in the magnetic field, and can utilize magnetic\
489 information for orientation or navigation, electromagnetic surveys have the potential to\
490 temporarily distort magnetic cues and associated directed movements (Kirschvink et al. 1986,\
491 Westerberg and Begout-Anras 2000, \'d6hman et al. 2007). The artificial magnetic fields could\
492 constitute a problem for long distance, time constrained, migrating animals with revealed\
493 magnetic senses, such as eels (Durif et al. 2013) or salmonids (Putman et al. 2013), or even\
494 species such as cod (God\'f8 1995, Robichaud and Rose 2002, Rose 1993) or herring\
495 (Dragesund et al. 1997), which use unknown migratory cues. Also local movements can be\
496 disrupted by magnetic field disturbances. For example, among terrestrial animals, a higher\
497 proportion of honey bees (Apis mellifera) failed to find the hive when exposed to artificial\
498 magnetic fields and solar storms (Ferrari 2014) and homing pigeons were delayed by\
499 magnetic storms (Schreiber and Rossi 1978), ). Magnetic gradients used for orientation may\
500 be small, and hence even small changes in the natural magnetic field caused by the artificial\
501 magnetic fields might disrupt local orientation. Also relatively small changes in orientation\
502 may cause the orienting animal to swim in the wrong direction or miss its target. This could,\
503 in theory, cause problems in for example homing lobsters (Boles and Lohmann 2003),\
504 juvenile turtles (Goff et al. 1998, Lohmann et al. 2001, Lohmann and Lohmann 1996), or\
505 landward orienting fish larvae and plankton (Bottesch et al. 2016, O'Connor and Muheim\
506 2017, Tomanova and Vacha 2016). As small disruptions of the local magnetic field occur,\
507 and even vary, at one locality for a longer period of time (perhaps hours instead of minutes),\
508 and at a greater distance from the source, during electromagnetic surveys. These disruptions\
509 might have severe effects, at least on the individual animal, if affecting essential, time510 restricted movements, such as finding protection from predation, or suitable and timely\
511 feeding areas for juvenile organisms.\
512 Some animals calibrate their internal compass against other spatial cues (Cresci et al. 2019b,\
513 Goff et al. 1998, Muheim et al. 2006). If such calibration occur relatively seldom,\
514 disturbances during this time may be especially costly. Migratory songbirds (Chatarus), for\
515 example, calibrate their magnetic compass using the direction of the sunset or associated\
516 polarization patterns once a day (Cochran et al. 2004). Animals may also, as has been\
517 suggested for bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii), use magnetic more intensive (dusk and dawn)\
518 or less disturbed (night) windows to obtain magnetic information with minimal influence of\
519 natural magnetic noise (Rodda 1984, Willis et al. 2009). Marine animals using such\
520 calibration windows, may end up moving in the wrong direction for a whole day, covering \
16\
521 expansive distances and using valuable energy and time, if exposed to a distorted magnetic\
522 field during the time of calibration (Ferrari 2014, Vanselow et al. 2018). This would\
523 exacerbate the effect of the electromagnetic disturbance beyond the time of exposure.\
524 As noted above, however, magnetic field variations are not uncommon in nature. In\
525 Norwegian waters animals experience from a few to hundreds of natural occurring magnetic\
526 disturbances (> 100 nT) per year, depending on latitude (Fig. 3) and time during the solar\
527 cycle. Disturbances commonly seen at high latitudes typically last from 30 min to 2 hours.\
528 Rarer, but larger, geomagnetic storms creating disturbances of the magnitude of several\
529 thousand nT, lasting for days, are also part of the natural geomagnetic landscape (Parkinson\
530 1983). During an electromagnetic survey, one point in the sea is typically exposed to levels\
531 like these or higher for only a fraction of an hour (Buchanan et al. 2011). It is likely that\
532 many animals can handle this variation in the magnetic field, perhaps by recognizing\
533 temporary noise, and pause directed movements or rely on other environmental cues (Freake\
534 et al. 2006). As natural geomagnetic disturbances are much more common at higher latitudes,\
535 animals at lower latitudes could also be less used or adapted to, and hence worse at handling\
536 electromagnetic disturbances (Vanselow et al. 2018). High latitude animals, exposed to a\
537 higher rate of natural disturbances, may, on the other hand, be more dependent on the quiet\
538 periods between frequent natural disturbances. It has, for example, been suggested that\
539 animals, to avoid geomagnetic noise during daytime, utilize the magnetically more stable\
540 nights to establish orientation (Rodda 1984).\
541 Lastly, in experiments, short but strong (4-5 ms; 40 \'96 500 mT) magnetic pulses have\
542 incapacitated the ability to orient after the magnetic field for a substantial period of time in\
543 such diverse taxa as logger head sea turtles (Irwin and Lohmann 2005), songbirds (Holland\
544 and Helm 2013, Wiltschko et al. 1994, Wiltschko et al. 1998), and bats (Holland et al. 2008).\
545 The inability to orient after the magnetic field lasted for 7-10 days after the exposure to the\
546 magnetic pulse (Holland and Helm 2013, Wiltschko et al. 1994, Wiltschko et al. 1998) It is\
547 believed that the short pulse alter the magnetization of magnetite particles involved in the\
548 magnetic sense of the exposed animal. For this to happen the pulse needs to be strong enough\
549 to re-magnetize the magnetic particles in the animal, and short enough so that the magnetic\
550 particles are unable to rotate in the magnetic field during the pulse (Irwin and Lohmann 2005,\
551 Wiltschko et al. 1998). In electromagnetic surveys, pulses are of longer duration and of lower\
552 magnitude than what was used in these experiments. Ferrari (2014), however, achieved\
553 similar delayed disorientation effects from a 80 seconds exposure to a 0.5 Hz magnetic field\
554 (200 \'b5T) which is just within the range of what can be experienced by an animal exposed to\
555 electromagnetic surveys. The potential risk of such prolonged disabling of the magnetic sense\
556 from electric magnetic surveys remain highly speculative.\
557 5.2 Potential behavioral effects of exposure to the electric field\
558 While magnetic cues are used for orientation, electric cues are, at least among elasmobranchs,\
559 also used for feeding, avoiding predation, and social interactions (Collin and Whitehead\
560 2004). Electric fields therefore have the potential to disrupt a wider range of behaviors.\
561 Elasmobranchs, and even eels, should be able to perceive signals from a typical\
562 electromagnetic survey at over a kilometer distance (Fig 3; Table 2; Buchanan et al. 2011,\
563 Peters et al. 2007). In theory, a perceived electric field could temporarily disrupt feeding,\
564 orientation, attention, or social interactions. For example, some elasmobranch species\
565 (Bakketeig et al. 2017, Pratt and Carrier 2001) gather in large mating or pupping \
17\
566 aggregations. Disruption of these aggregations or related behaviors could potentially have\
567 detrimental effects on already threatened species (IUCN 2018).\
568 Further, it is also not obvious to predict how electro-sensitive animals would react to an\
569 approaching and increasing electric field. A fluctuating and moving electric field of an\
570 electromagnetic survey does not necessarily translate directly to the relatively stable electric\
571 fields of an ocean current. Also, an electric signal could, depending on characteristics and\
572 context, affect fish behavior even if very weak (Grimsb\'f8 et al. 2014, Kalmijn 1999). In\
573 addition, and also not studied, it is possible that the sudden changes in electric fields, or\
574 magnetic fields, could cause escape responses, stress or changed feeding behavior extending\
575 beyond the duration of exposure, as seen in relation to acoustic noise from seismic surveys\
576 (Eng\'e5s et al. 1996).\
577 6. Conclusions\
578 The electric and magnetic fields induced during electromagnetic surveys are within the scope\
579 of what is detectable by marine animals, and the generated fields will potentially affect the\
580 behavior of perceptive animals. As the electric and magnetic fields both attenuate rapidly,\
581 effects should be limited to within a few kilometers of the conducted survey. Exposures are\
582 also of relatively short duration, and the major part of the exposures consists of levels in the\
583 magnitude of regularly occurring natural electromagnetic disturbance. The lack of studies on\
584 effects on animal behavior is, however, a reason for concern. From available data,\
585 elasmobranchs seem to be the most electro-sensitive marine animals, and at highest risk of\
586 being disrupted by generated electric fields. Regarding the induced magnetic field, animals\
587 using magnetic cues for migration or local orientation during restricted time-windows might\
588 be most likely to be affected by an electromagnetic survey. This effect would be exacerbated\
589 if the exposure coincides with calibration of the animal\'92s magnetic compass or results in\
590 temporary retained disorientation. As a starting point, research efforts may focus on the\
591 effects of the survey induced electromagnetic fields on animal movement and orientation, and\
592 effects of the induced electric fields on elasmobranch behavior.}{\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252\cocoartf2577

\f0\fs24 \cf0 Perception and Behavioral Effects of Electromagnetic Fields\
\
Some animals respond to extremely low levels of electromagnetic fields (EMF), usually at frequencies ranging from DC to extremely-low-frequency (ELF) and usually with specialized receptors.1 Although the responses have been described and can be demonstrated at will, the mechanisms are not understood. Perceptual and behavioral responses to very low levels of EMFs at low frequency and above have not been reported in humans, and there are no mechanisms at DC or ELF that might imply as yet unreported responses, although they cannot be excluded. There is a considerable literature on perception and behavioral responses to stimulation at magnitudes consistent with direct electrical stimulation of nervous tissues by induced currents in the tissue, but they are limited to the frequency ranges that stimulate excitable membranes.\
\
In the radiofrequency (RF) range of concern for assessment of GWEN sites, there have been many reports of sensory perception. The responses may be organized in the following categories:\
\
Stimulation of nervous structures by electric and magnetic fields and associated currents in the body. Above a threshold that is frequency-dependent, these currents are perceived as a painful stimulus that increases with current intensity.\
Electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in cats and rabbits has been reported to be altered by exposure to amplitude-modulated RF. Exposure to 147-MHz fields, amplitude-modulated between 1 and 25 Hz, altered the ability of cats to produce selected EEG rhythms. Changes in EEG frequency spectrum were also observed in rabbits chronically exposed to 1-10 MHz fields that were amplitude-modulated at 14-16 Hz.2 Other studies have shown small changes in EEG patterns, particularly desynchronization, in rats and rabbits after exposure to 12.95-GHz field at 1 W/kg.3,4 n Some later studies failed to find an effect. The lowest levels used, in the above studies are 10,000 times that which would be encountered near GWEN installations.\
Shocks and burns. When the human body is in an EMF of suitable frequency and intensity and it makes contact with a conducting body in the same field, an electrical current is produced that can cause perceptible electrical shock, muscular contractions, burns, and possible death.\
Heating. If enough RF power is absorbed in human tissue, especially skin, it can raise the tissue temperature and cause a sensation of warming that will be due to thermal stimulation of temperature receptors. Thermal perception of absorbed RF energy is frequency-dependent: the threshold energy decreases as the frequency increases.5 There is a delay in the perception of warmth after the start of irradiation; the delay may vary from 5 sec or more at GHz frequencies to as little as 1 sec for infrared radiation.6 Justesen et al.7 compared thermal perception in human volunteers who were irradiated on the forearm in a 100-cm2 area with far-infrared radiation or 2.45-GHz microwave radiation. The thresholds of perception for a 10-sec exposure were 1.7 mW/cm2 for far infrared radiation and 26.7 mW/cm2 for microwave radiation.\
Auditory perception. A special effect has been reported in which microwave RF emitted in the form of very short pulses (1-20 \'b5sec) is perceived by humans and animals as clicks or other sounds. This perception could well result when thermal absorption leads to thermoelastic expansion of tissues and fluids in the head and is sensed by auditory receptors. If the energy flux in the pulse exceeds about 40 \'b5J/cm2, delivered in a few microseconds, auditory perceptions occur.8\
The auditory perception of pulsed microwave fields was first reported in 1947 and has been studied extensively. Frey9 reported on controlled experimental exposures at frequencies of 0.2-8.9 GHz and pulse widths of 1-1,000 \'b5sec. He found that, depending on the characteristics of the field, sensations were perceived as buzzing, ticking, hissing, or knocking sounds. Sound was perceived at all frequencies up to 8.9 GHz. Guy et al.10 demonstrated that the threshold for auditory perception was four times higher at 3.75 kHz in subjects with neurosensory deficits compared with normal subjects, thus indicating that the effect was in the acoustic elements involved in hearing.\
Behavioral changes. Epidemiologic studies of groups of people occupationally or environmentally exposed to electromagnetic fields in the RF and ELF range have yielded perceptual and behavioral responses, including fatigue, difficulty in concentrating, and increased frequency of headaches. A number of researchers have used disruption of behavior patterns, such as work stoppage, to study the effect of RF fields on animals, including rodents11-13 and monkeys.14 Several carrier frequencies, field zones, and modulation characteristics were used. A relatively narrow range of threshold of specific absorption rates (SARs), about 4-9 W/kg, was found. Lebovitz15 examined the effect of repeated exposures to a pulsed 1,300-MHz field on behavioral performance in rats. He exposed animals to SARs of 1.6, 3.6, or 6.7 W/kg for 3 h/day, 5 d/wk for 6-9 wk and found that rates of lever-pressing for food were slightly reduced at the highest SAR. However, the ability of the rats to discriminate improved as a positive function of SAR when lever-pressing was not reinforced by the presence of food. DeLorge16 used a different experimental paradigm and showed a disruption in performance of rats at an SAR of 2.5 W/kg when they were exposed to a pulsed 1,300-MHz field. Behavioral studies performed by Hjeresen et al.17 showed that rats placed in a shuttlebox tended to remain in the side shielded from pulsed RF fields. Because the rats also tended to avoid pulsed sound waves, the investigators suggested that the rats' avoidance of the RF fields might be related to the hearing of the pulsed fields. The response to a pulsed field is stronger than that to a continuous field. For example, Carroll et al.18 found that rats exposed to an intense field that was not pulse-modulated did not readily learn to escape from it. It appears that hearing the pulses is a more effective cue for escaping than is the warming that results from a continuous field.\
Studies in Eastern Europe have investigated populations exposed to EMFs ranging from 50 Hz to microwave frequencies.19 Complaints included irritability, lethargy, insomnia, impotence, headaches, loss of memory, and inability to concentrate. The syndrome was identified as neurasthenia or ''microwave sickness." Energy magnitudes associated with the syndrome have been reported for a few microwatts to a few thousand microwatts per square centimeter. An epidemiologic study of the personnel in the American embassy in Moscow found an excess of the same neurasthenic symptoms, but the symptoms were not correlated with measured individual exposures.20\
\
Eastern European investigators have also reported on rats and rabbits exposed for one to several hours a day over periods of weeks or months. Power densities ranging from 0.6 to 30,000 \'b5W/cm2 were reported to alter conditional reflexes21 and decrease latency of audiogenic seizures.22 Attempts to confirm the findings were made by several investigators; some effects of exposure to RF fields were found, but most were at higher field intensities, and in general the results did not support the findings from Eastern Europe.\
\
Studies with ELF fields have suggested that behavior can be influenced by exposure to either magnetic or electric fields. Persinger23 reported that prenatal exposure of rats to 0.5-Hz, 0.05-to 3-mT fields, resulted in changes in juvenile or adult rats' emotionality and ability to perform a conditioned-suppression test. Frey24 found that prenatal exposure of rats to a 60-Hz field at 3.5 kV/m caused changes in open-field activity.\
\
McGivern et al.25 studied male rats that had been exposed prenatally on days 15-21 of gestation. Exposures were for 15 min twice a day, to a 15-Hz, 800-\'b5T pulsed magnetic field. Exposed animals showed a significant reduction in scent marking, compared with sham-exposed or caged controls. Exposed males had larger seminal vesicles, prostates, and epididymides than did control males.\
\
Transient neurobehavioral changes in rats exposed prenatally and postnatally to a 60-Hz electric field (65-kV/m effective field) were reported by Sikov et al.26 Exposed animals showed significantly more motility than did controls. Development of righting reflex and negative geotropism was also delayed in exposed rats; the percentage of pups that failed to show these behaviors was increased on day 14 of postnatal life, but not on day 21.\
\
Lovely et al.27 exposed gravid Sprague-Dawley rats to a 60-kV/m, 60-Hz electric field and then tested the offspring at the age of 90 days in three tasks: shuttlebox avoidance, a residential maze, and a preference-avoidance test. No differences were noted between exposed and sham-exposed animals.\
\
Changes in learning have been reported in rats exposed to a combination of 60-Hz electric fields (30 kV/m and 0.1 mT) and magnetic fields (10 kV/m and 0.033 mT) throughout gestation and during the first 8 days of postnatal life.28 Both acquisition and extinction of a schedule-controlled response were affected in the exposed animals. In contrast, other studies failed to find an effect of exposure to ELF fields on behavior.29,30\
\
Exposure to 60-Hz electric fields (30 or 60 kV/m) has been reported to affect the social behavior of baboons.31,32 The investigators used a number of measures of social behavior, but found that passive affinity, tension, and stereotypy performance were significantly increased in exposed groups. The authors suggested that the changes might indicate a stress response to the fields.\
\
Although there is evidence that exposure of experimental animals to electric or magnetic fields can influence neurobehavioral function, there is a paucity of direct observations at the 175-kHz frequency and at the ultra-high frequencies of 200400 MHz used in the GWEN system. Moreover, magnitudes of the exposure usually required to produce an effect are substantially higher than those likely to be encountered as a result of operation of the GWEN system. It therefore seems unlikely that electromagnetic fields from GWEN will affect neurosensory or neurobehavioral function in persons living around GWEN sites.}{\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252\cocoartf2577

Animal Eyes\
\
Abstract: To understand how bees, birds, and fish may use\
colour vision for food selection and mate choice, we reconstructed views of biologically important objects taking into\
account the receptor spectral sensitivities. Reflectance spectra of flowers, bird plumage, and fish skin were used to\
calculate receptor quantum catches. The quantum catches\
were then coded by \'93red,\'94 \'93green,\'94 and \'93blue\'94 of a\
computer monitor; and flowers, birds, and fish were visualized in \'93animal colours.\'94 Calculations were performed\
for different illumination conditions. To simulate colour\
constancy, we used a von Kries algorithm, i.e., the receptor\
quantum catches were scaled so that the colour of illumination remained invariant. We show that on land this algorithm compensates reasonably well for changes of object\
appearance caused by natural changes of illumination,\
while in water failures of von Kries colour constancy are\
prominent. \'a9 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Col Res Appl, 26,\

INTRODUCTION\
Most of what we see in the natural environment comprises\
brown and green backgrounds, among which colourful patterns of plants and animals may be concealed or flamboyantly displayed. These colour signals have been evolved for\
eyes different from ours. Plants often use brightly coloured\
flowers to advertise a reward of nectar and pollen to the\
insects and birds that pollinate them. Birds use colourful\
plumage to attract mates. Similarly, colourful patterns of\
fish skin are used to communicate with other fish. Animals\
also use coloured patterns to protect themselves\'97a coloured pattern may help conceal or disguise an animal, or\
advertise that it is toxic.\
Colours convey information, and to make a correct food\
or mate choice animals need to perceive colours constantly\
in varying illumination. Several experimental studies have\
shown that animals can compensate for changes of colour\
caused by changes of illumination spectra.1 However, colour constancy fails when illumination colour saturates. One\
of the first proposed models of colour constancy, a von\
Kries transformation, assumes that signals of photoreceptors are scaled so that colour of illumination remains invariant. Such an algorithm can be implemented by receptor\
adaptation, and so invokes the simplest physiological mechanism; no special-purpose neural circuitry is required. Although it is not known which algorithm of colour constancy\
animals use, the von Kries model yields predictions that\
agree with results of behavioral experiments.2,3 Generally,\
von Kries transformation does not lead to perfect colour\
constancy, and here we ask how well this transformation\
may compensate for changes of colour.\
We consider flower colours as seen by bees, bird colours\
seen by birds, and colours of coral reef fish for fish eyes.\
Colour can be quantified by a set of receptor quantum\
catches, which, in turn, can be calculated for any light\
stimulus if receptor spectral sensitivities are known. Receptor spectral sensitivities in animals\'92 eyes differ substantially\
from ours and, thus, our colour perception says little about\
colour appearance for animals. We have 3 types of receptors\

(henceforth S for short-, M for middle-, and L for longwavelength receptors), which are sensitive from blue to red\
in the spectrum [Fig 1(a)]. By comparison, bees also have 3\
receptors, but these peak in the green, blue, and UV part of\
the spectrum4 [Fig. 1(b)]. Birds typically have four receptors. In addition to S, M, and L receptors, they have \'93very\
short-wavelength\'94 receptors (VS), which may peak either in\
UV or in violet part of the spectrum5 [Fig 1(c)]. Due to cone\
filters\'97coloured oil droplets\'97spectral sensitivities of S,\
M, and L receptors in birds are narrower then in humans or\
bees.5 Some fishes (including goldfish) have four receptors,\
but many fishes, including some of the colourful species that\
live on coral reefs, have only 2 or 3, where the S receptor\
may peak either in the UV, violet, or blue part of the\
spectrum6 [Fig. 1(d)].\
Colour depends on both reflectance and illumination\
spectra. In terrestrial habitats, typical illuminations are standard daylights7 (normal light: D65; blue-sky-dominated\
light: D75; sun-dominated light: D55) and greenish illumination filtered by leaves in forest [Fig. 2(a)]. In water,\
absorption and scattering of light is wavelength-dependent.\
Therefore, illumination spectra in water change rapidly with\
depth and also depend on whether an object is illuminated\
from above or by side light [Fig. 2(b)]. Also, in water, light\
is absorbed and scattered on the path from the object to the\
eye. Hence, colours may change with the distance from\
which objects are viewed. Generally, colour constancy in\
water should be more difficult than in air, and we consider\
terrestrial and aquatic habitats separately.\
METHODS\
To calculate quantum catches, we use the following equations. In air, quantum catches, Qi\
, are given by\
Qi 5 ki E Ri\
~l!S~l!I~l!dl, (1)\
where i 5 L, M, S, (VS) denoting the spectral type of a\
receptor, Ri\
(l) denotes receptor spectral sensitivities, ki are\
the scaling factors, S(l) and I(l) denote surface reflectance\
and illumination spectra, respectively, and integration is\
performed over the range where visual system is sensitive.\
Mathematical formulation of von Kries colour constancy is\
straightforward \'97 the scaling factors, ki , depend on illumination spectra:\

media14 (Marshall et al., unpublished).\

Consequently, the response of a receptor to the illuminant is\
by definition unity. In water, quantum catches depend on the\
distance to an object, z, and the following equations are\
valid:\
Qi\
~z! 5 ki E Ri\
~l!GS~l, z!dl, (3)\
where the spectrum of light entering the eye, GS(l,z), depends on the reflectance spectrum of a viewed surface, S(l).\

where a1(l) and a2(l) denote, respectively, narrow beam\
and scatter attenuation coefficients, I\

(l) is the background\
space light.8 The first term in Eq. (4) describes attenuation\
of the light on the way from a surface to the eye; the second\
term describes the light that, due to scatter, is added to light\
between a reflecting surface and the eye. One consequence\
of the light scatter is a veiling effect, which reduces contrast, and changes colour appearance in much the same way\
as fog on land.\
An image of an object as seen through the animal\'92s eyes\
can be represented by a set of quantum catches corresponding to each point of the image. To show quantum catches,\
we use the colours of a computer monitor, and, in the case\
of trichromatic vision, \'93blue,\'94 \'93green,\'94 and \'93red\'94 of the\
monitor correspond to quantum catches of S, M, and L\
receptors, respectively. To show a pattern as it is seen\
through a tetrachromatic eye, we make two images: in the\
first one \'93blue,\'94 \'93green,\'94 and \'93red\'94 code, respectively,\
quantum catches of S, M, and L receptors; in the second one\
\'93blue\'94 and \'93green\'94 code S and M quantum catches, \'93red\'94\
codes the VS receptor. It is important to note that we do not\
know how animals perceive colours\'97the code we use\
shows only the information from which the nervous system\
may form colour. Generally, the larger the changes in receptor signals, the larger are the changes in colour appearance. Therefore, inspection of images, where quantum\
catches are coded with colours, allows us to judge whether\
or not an object\'92s appearance changes strongly, but we\
make no inferences about colour appearance.\
To obtain reflectance spectra in each point of the image,\
we used two methods. (I) Flower views were reconstructed\
from the images recorded with a UV-sensitive camera\
through coloured filters.9 The set of filters were selected so\
that the error of reconstruction of previously measured 1056\
flower reflectance spectra was minimal. (II) To reconstruct\
images of birds and fishes, we measured reflectance spectra10 of feathers or fish skin from different body regions.\
Coloured photographs of animals were examined, and a\
relation between colours in photographs and type of reflectance spectra was established. Special-purpose software was\
used to substitute the colours in the photograph with the\
colour code for receptor quantum catches. Brightness was\
adjusted in accordance with differences in spectra between\
the sensitivity of human luminosity vision and receptor\
sensitivities in animals.\
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\
A flower as it is seen through the eye of a bee in different\
illumination conditions is shown in Fig. 3. Spatial resolution\
of a bee\'92s compound eye is significantly lower then ours.\
The compound eye of a bee is formed by ommatidia in a\
hexagonal lattice. Each ommatidium contains all three spectral types of the photoreceptor cells. Resolution of a compound eye is defined by interommatidial angles and by the\
acceptance angle of a single ommatidium.11 Examination of\
projections of flowers onto a compound eye of a bee9 (Fig.\
3, right panel) shows that bees cannot resolve details of\
flower pattern from a long distance. Unlike our camera-type\
eye, the compound eye may only resolve well at very close\
distance, and bees can, theoretically, see fine patterns of a\
flower only when they sit on it (Fig. 3, left panel). Changes\
of illumination yield a notable shift in quantum catches.\
However, if corrected by the von Kries algorithm, it is\
difficult to see any differences between a flower illuminated\
by standard D65 light and that illuminated by different\
natural lights. In the case of a bird looking at a bird (Fig. 4)\
colour is practically invariant after correcting by the von\
Kries algorithm. Birds have receptor sensitivities narrowed\

by oil droplets, which make von Kries colour constancy\
particularly effective.10 Generally, our observations indicate\
that in terrestrial habitats von Kries mechanism of colour\
constancy compensates reasonably well for changes of illumination.\
Figure 5 shows a fish as seen through fish eyes. Although\
illumination spectra in water change strongly, von Kries\
colour constancy works well, if the fish is viewed from a\
short distance, when scatter and absorption in water does\
not play a role. However, von Kries colour constancy fails,\
if the fish is viewed from a distance. In the latter case, the\
spectrum of the light entering the eye is further modified by\
wavelength-dependent absorption and scatter, and the simple coefficient rule as postulated by von Kries no longer\
compensates for changes in the colour.\
Our conclusions are based on inspection of images obtained by modeling quantum catches of the eyes that might\
naturally view them. A more accurate study would compare\
the shifts of colour with colour thresholds. Analysis of a\
large body of plumage colours shows that, for some plumage colours, the shifts do not exceed thresholds, while\
colour constancy fails for others.10 The strongest colour\
shifts are, in average, yielded by change of illumination\
from the standard daylight (D65) to green light of sunlight\
filtered through leaves.}{\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252\cocoartf2577

\f0\fs24 \cf0 Animal Cryptochromes: Divergent Roles in Light Perception, Circadian\
Timekeeping and Beyond.\
\
Cryptochromes are evolutionarily related to the light-dependent DNA repair enzyme photolyase, serving as major regulators of circadian rhythms in insects and vertebrate animals.\
There are two types of cryptochromes in the animal kingdom: Drosophila-like CRYs that act as nonvisual photopigments linking circadian rhythms to the environmental light/\
dark cycle, and vertebrate-like CRYs that do not appear to\
sense light directly, but control the generation of circadian\
rhythms by acting as transcriptional repressors. Some\
animals have both types of CRYs, while others possess only\
one. Cryptochromes have two domains, the photolyase\
homology region (PHR) and an extended, intrinsically disordered C-terminus. While all animal CRYs share a high\
degree of sequence and structural homology in their PHR\
domains, the C-termini are divergent in both length and\
sequence identity. Recently, cryptochrome function has been\
shown to extend beyond its pivotal role in circadian clocks,\
participating in regulation of the DNA damage response, cancer progression and glucocorticoid signaling, as well as being\
implicated as possible magnetoreceptors. In this review, we\
provide a historical perspective on the discovery of animal\
cryptochromes, examine similarities and differences of the\
two types of animal cryptochromes and explore some of the\
divergent roles for this class of proteins.\
INTRODUCTION\
Earth receives almost all of its energy from the Sun\'92s radiation,\
which provides the driving force for the photosynthetic production of oxygen, patterns of climate and weather and the coordination of our behavior and physiology with its daily light/dark\
cycle. Sunlight also contains harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation\
that can induce mutations in DNA to interfere with genetic\
stability. One of the most elegant solutions for the repair of\
UV-induced DNA damage occurs by a process termed\
photoreactivation, in which UV-induced pyrimidine dimers are\
repaired enzymatically with blue light (1). Photolyase enzymes\
specifically recognize cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers or pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts, both of which accumulate\
when DNA is exposed to sunlight (2,3). After recognition of\
damaged DNA, photolyase captures a photon of blue light with\
one of its two light-harvesting cofactors, a secondary antenna\
chromophore (either methenyltetrahydrofolate (MTHF) or the\
deazaflavin, 8-HDF) or the catalytic chromophore flavin adenine\
dinucleotide (FAD), which undergoes an electron transfer cycle\
to split the pyrimidine dimer (4).\
Not all organisms possess the capability to photoreactivate;\
those that do not have photolyase use mechanisms such as\
nucleotide excision repair to replace damaged DNA (5). Photolyase homologs that lack DNA repair activity, known as cryptochromes, were first discovered over 20 years ago in plants,\
followed by insects, vertebrates, and are now found across the\
domains of life (6). By definition, cryptochromes lack DNA\
repair activity, but they capitalize on their evolutionary\
relationship to photolyase to regulate other aspects of our intimate biological relationship with the Sun. Although insect and\
vertebrate-like cryptochromes have different functions, both\
remain primarily associated with biological clocks that serve as\
an interface between host physiology, behavior and the daily\
light/dark cycle. However, new roles are being revealed for animal cryptochromes outside circadian clocks, including their\
involvement in cancer biology and the response to DNA damage,\
metabolic signaling and possibly even in magnetoreception.\
Here, we provide a historical perspective on our understanding\
of cryptochromes and how our knowledge of photolyase structure and function has informed studies on cryptochrome.\
Biological timekeeping by circadian rhythms\
Circadian rhythms are nearly 24-h rhythms of physiology and\
behavior that are a nearly ubiquitous feature of eukaryotic life.\
These internal rhythms were first noted by Jean-Jacques de Marain (1678\'961771), who observed that the daily opening and closing of the flowers of a Mimosa plant persisted in total darkness.\
The modern field of circadian rhythms was established by J\'80urgen\
Aschoff (1913\'961998) and Colin Pittendrigh (1918\'961996), who\
delineated the defining properties of these rhythms: Circadian\

rhythms are self-sustaining in the absence of external time cues\
and possess an intrinsic (or free-running) period of approximately\
24 h under constant conditions such as complete darkness.\
Circadian rhythms are synchronized (or entrained) to the 24-h\
solar light/dark cycle and exhibit relatively constant free-running\
periods with changes in temperature (7).\
Under 24-h light/dark cycles (i.e. 12-h light and 12-h dark, or\
LD 12:12), circadian rhythms demonstrate a period of exactly\
24 h. However, in constant conditions that occur in the absence of\
environmental cues, these rhythms display their internal free-running periods, which are close to, but usually not exactly, 24 h. For\
instance, the human sleep\'96wake cycle has a free-running period of\
about 24.3 h, while the mouse has a rest\'96activity rhythm with a\
free-running period of about 23.6 h (8). Light acts as a time cue\
(or Zeitgeber) to entrain internal rhythms to the exact 24-h solar\
day. Light accomplishes this by shifting the phase of free-running\
rhythms to match the environmental light/dark cycle. Most organisms share a common phase response to light, whereby a short\
pulse of light during the subjective day (i.e. a time that coincides\
with daytime based on the free-running clock of an organism in\
complete darkness) does not shift the clock, but a pulse of light in\
the early subjective night phase delays the clock, while the same\
pulse of light given in the late subjective night phase advances the\
clock. By virtue of being able to shift the phase of internal rhythms\
with brief pulses of light, circadian clocks provide organisms with\
the ability to align physiology and behavior to daily environmental\
cycles for enhanced fitness (9). Remarkably, the spectral character\
of light that phase-shifts the clock is also relatively conserved\
across a broad range of phylogeny and is centered in the blue portion of the spectrum.\
Circadian rhythms in Drosophila. Colin Pittendrigh was the first\
to study the circadian rhythms of Drosophila (7). He noted that\
flies show two separate free-running rhythms, one of eclosion\
from pupae to adult and a second in locomotion. Both are\
entrainable by light. Using Drosophila genetics, Ron Konopka\
(1947\'962015) and Seymour Benzer (1921\'962007) performed mutagenesis on flies and identified three mutants with abnormal freerunning rhythms (one with a long period, one with a short period\
and an arrhythmic mutant) (10). Remarkably, all three mapped to\
a single gene, dubbed period due to its profound effects on the\
timing, or period, of circadian rhythms (11,12). Equally remarkably, period mutants affected both eclosion rhythms and locomotor rhythms in the same way. Work over several decades since\
has demonstrated that the circadian clock mechanism in Drosophila consists of a small number of dedicated clock genes (i.e.\
period, timeless, clock, cycle) that establish a time-delayed transcription\'96translation feedback loop controlling circadian expression of a number of genes (13).\
\
SUMMARY AND PERSPECTIVES\
The very name of cryptochromes appropriately hints at our cryptic\
understanding of their many biological functions (137). Since their\
discovery over 20 years ago in plants, a large part of our understanding of cryptochrome function has been drawn from our\
knowledge of photolyase structure and function (4). However, it\
is clear that cryptochromes are a family of functionally diverse\
proteins in their own right. Some cryptochromes act as photopigments to control circadian photoentrainment and possibly even\
magnetoreception, while others have apparently lost the ability to\
sense light and have been co-opted as transcriptional regulators\
and participants in intracellular signaling cascades that control circadian timing, metabolism and cellular responses to DNA damage.\
As more insight is brought to light about cryptochrome structure\
and function, we hope to fully realize their far-reaching influence\
over many aspects of animal behavior and physiology}{\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252\cocoartf2577

\
Weak radio frequency fields seem to affect the body clocks of cockroaches. If the finding is confirmed, it could mean that weak radio waves \'96 which are already known to disorient birds \'96 are capable of affecting a wide range of animals.\
\
However, Martin Vacha of Masaryk University in the Czech Republic, who conducted the study, says he is \'93very cautious\'94 about his team\'92s results. In normal conditions, there might not be any effect on insects, he says, and the team isn\'92t making any claims about possible effects on people.\

Other scientists are sceptical, and say the study needs to be independently confirmed.\

Many claims have been made about possible effects of electromagnetic fields on humans and other animals. In particular, it is been claimed that the radio waves from mobile phones could cause cancer. But radio waves are much less energetic than, say, X-rays and don\'92t cause the damage to DNA that leads to cancer. Nonetheless, some researchers think they could have more subtle effects on living tissue.\
\
A couple of recent studies, for instance, have suggested that static magnetic fields affect the body clock of fruit flies. Vacha and his colleagues decided to look at whether they affect cockroaches too.\
\
Slowing down the clock\
His team kept cockroaches in constant dim UV light, with no clues as to whether it was night or day, and measured the animals\'92 activity using image analysis software. From that they worked out what time their body clocks were keeping.\
\
When they exposed the animals to either static magnetic fields or weak radio frequency broadband noise, the cockroaches\'92 periods of activity became an hour or two longer. In other words, their body clocks were running more slowly.\
\
Vacha says the team tested frequencies much lower than those from mobile phones. But many electric devices, such as computers, produce this kind of broadband noise.\
\
However, had the cockroaches been exposed to natural light cycles, the radio frequencies would probably have had little impact, says Vacha. \'93My guess is that in real life it does not have such a big effect.\'94\
\
While many studies have suggested that magnetic or electric fields affect animals in various ways, these results often fail to stand up when others repeat the tests, says Peter Hore at the University of Oxford. \'93Replication is crucial in this field.\'94\
\
Hore says his own team has failed to replicate two studies that found that magnetic fields affect the behaviour of fruit flies in a maze, and their climbing speed in tubes.\
\
Disoriented birds\
However, one finding has stood up. Several studies have now shown that very weak radio frequency noise can disorient small migratory songbirds held in cages, says Hore. That is intriguing because the leading theory for how birds detect magnetic fields is via proteins called cryptochromes \'96 and cryptochromes also play a key role in maintaining circadian rhythms in animals.\
\
Vacha thinks radio waves may interfere with animal body clocks via cryptochromes. His team has previously shown that disabling a cryptochrome gene in cockroaches prevents them detecting magnetic fields.\
\
But the radio waves that disrupt the orientation of caged birds are in theory a thousand times too weak to affect cryptochromes, says Hore, so the mechanism still isn\'92t clear. \'93It\'92s a bit of a puzzle.\'94\

There is also no evidence that wild birds are affected by electromagnetic fields. They may fly high enough to avoid interference, Hore says.\
\
Some people believe they are \'93hypersensitive\'94 to electromagnetic fields and suffer adverse effects such as headaches. But tests have found that such people are unable to tell whether or not they have been exposed to fields.}{\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252\cocoartf2577

\f0\fs24 \cf0 The impacts of artificial Electromagnetic\
Radiation on wildlife (flora and fauna).\
Current knowledge overview: a background\
document to the web conference\
A report of the EKLIPSE project\
\
Objectives\
This overview aims to identify which main taxonomic groups, which types of EMR, and associated effects\
have been addressed by the existing studies.\
It will also assess the level of quality/reliability of the available studies on both technical and\
biological/ecological aspects.\
Based on this overview, key knowledge gaps and assessments of the quality of the studies have been\
identified and have served as the basis of discussions for the larger consultation (web conference) that was\
organised by EKLIPSE at the beginning of 2018. This background document should be considered as a\
technical working report and does not aim to be exhaustive but rather to provide a first step in the analysis\
of the currently available knowledge and future research needs.\
EKLIPSE \'96 Current knowledge about impacts of EMR on wildlife 5 of 28\
2. Knowledge overview methodology\
2.1Scoping of the literature\
The literature used was restricted to peer-reviewed articles. The search for publications was made on the ISI\
Web of Knowledge platform and it was completed by searches on Google Scholar, using the following\
combinations of keywords:\
- EMR; EMF; electrosmog; electromagnetic field; electromagnetic radiation; electromagnetic\
AND\
- wildlife; invertebrate(s); vertebrate(s); plant(s); animal(s); insect(s); arthropod(s); bee(s); drosophila;\
mammal(s); fish; amphibian(s); bird(s); tree(s); flower(s); biodiversity.\
The publications cited in the identified papers were also examined to complement the list. A further search\
was done with the names of recurring experts. Only recent papers (from 2000 onwards) were considered.\
The focus was made on wildlife (plants, invertebrates, vertebrates), although a few studies on domestic\
animals have been included.\
The range of EMR types has also been restricted to artificial anthropogenic radiations. For example, it does\
not include research on the effects of light, the Earth\'92s magnetic field, MRI-strength magnetic field, etc.)\
Studies that were considered out of this scope were discarded and not used in the analysis.\
A Call for Knowledge was launched on the EKLIPSE KNOCK Forum (interactive discussion platform) and\
additional publications, suggested by the contributors, were added to the list. Finally, the experts from the\
Experts Steering Group provided a few more relevant sources.\
In total, 147 scientific papers or reviews were identified, and 97 of them were used in the analyses (see list\
of References).\
This final list of publications does not aim to be comprehensive, but to compile a representative set of papers\
and studies to allow an overview of the current knowledge and gaps.\
2.2Structuring of the literature and analyses\
The Experts Steering Group structured the analyses in two different axes. On one hand, the\
biologists/ecologists divided the work amongst them according to three major taxonomic groups: 1/\
invertebrates, 2/ vertebrates, 3/ plants. On the other hand, the physicists/engineers have created 15\
categories of anthropogenic radiation types based on frequency and exposure identified by codes (see Table\
1).\

Then, an analytical grid was produced with the publications identified per taxonomic group and radiation\
type. Different comment sections were added to assess the quality of the studies (technological aspects and\
biological aspects), the conditions of the studies, the results, the knowledge gaps, etc.\
The following rating system was used:\
1. bad quality\
2. minimum quality, with some elements that can be used\
3. normal quality, some gaps\
4. excellent\
2.3Assessment of the confidence levels of the studies\
In this background document, we make an initial attempt to distil the assessment of the published scientific\
literature into a series of \'91key messages\'92, which are succinct statements aimed at conveying important \
EKLIPSE \'96 Current knowledge about impacts of EMR on wildlife 7 of 28\
information to the web conference participants and, ultimately, to decision-makers. The scientific evidence\
assessed included empirical data, theory, and models.\
Confidence increases towards the top-right corner as suggested by the increasing strength of shading. Source: modified from Moss\
and Schneider (2000).\
Figure 1 Four-box model for the qualitative communication of confidence.\
For scientists and decision-makers to understand the level of the potential problem it is crucial that the\
degree of confidence in each key message is evaluated and communicated in ways that are effective but\
simple enough for a range of audiences to understand. In our assessment of the published evidence about\
the effects of EMR on wildlife we employ a qualitative \'91four-box model\'92 to communicate the level of certainty\
in knowledge, this allows us to show how each key message is based on the assessment of the quantity,\
quality and level of expert agreement in the evidence (see Figure 1). This model follows and is adopted from\
the Intergovernmental Platform for Biodiversity & Ecosystem Services (IPBES, 2016), which in turn adapted\
the model from Moss and Schneider (2000), which uses this approach to convey messages of its assessments\
to intergovernmental policymaking.\

3. Key results: current state of knowledge\
3.1 Quality of the studies in terms of technical aspects\
a. Invertebrates\
This document aims to frame the current knowledge about the impacts of EMR on wildlife as based on an\
assessment of the scientific literature. It is expected that debate and challenge during the web conference\
will either confirm our assessment of the evidence, the level of certainty, and the knowledge gaps or produce\
additional evidence that may stimulate a reassessment of the evidence and the resulting key messages to\
decision makers.\
The quality of published studies investigating the impacts of EMR on invertebrates is very mixed. On the one\
hand, results from studies carried out in the laboratory are often not transferable to real life situations due\
to an oversimplification of effects and the limited exposure (both in time and space) to EMR of the subjects.\
On the other hand, field studies suffer from a multitude of unmeasured potential effects that are indirectly\
related to EMR levels and can often not be disentangled, thereby confounding analysis. Field studies also\
often suffer from (very) low replication which makes drawing firm conclusions difficult.\
Certain studies of very poor scientific quality (e.g. no or very low replication) employed highly artificial EMR\
treatments, such as placing a mobile phone either inside or immediately adjacent to honey bee hives. This\
represented a highly field-unrealistic exposure to a source of EMR and, even putting issues of replication\
aside, would mean no rigorous conclusions can be reached.\
b. Vertebrates\
Studies on the effects of time-varying magnetic fields on vertebrates are highly variable in terms of the\
exposure and the read-outs used to investigate possible effects. The magnetic fields range from extremely\
low frequency power line fields \'93applied\'94 in the field to highly controlled gigahertz fields in the laboratory.\
Study qualities in terms of technical aspects are equally inhomogeneous. Not even half of the studies\
assessed were given the highest technical ranking (see Appendix II - Tables with number of assessed studies).\
The often poor design and missing control experiments impair assessment of the validity of the results and\
are likely to be the main reason for a low number of cross-laboratory replicated results. Unfortunately, the\
great variability in the qualities of primary research papers is not reflected in many reviews on the topic.\
Often, these reviews do not report selection criteria for the inclusion of studies. In addition, reviews suffer\
from the problem of comparing studies with highly variable descriptions of technical details on exposure\
parameters which hampers condensing similarities among the findings. In our assessment the studies with\
the lowest ratings in terms of technical aspects were:\
1. Not blinding the experimenters\
2. Not including appropriate controls\
3. Inadequately characterized EMR exposure\
We recommend that both laboratory studies and field studies which are equally important should apply to\
standard methodological criteria which are listed below in 3.1.4. As biologists are usually not experts on RFphysics, collaborations with physicists and engineers are crucial to achieve reliable exposure conditions.\
Studies on the effects of exposure in the fields should be accompanied by lab studies which simulate the \
EKLIPSE \'96 Current knowledge about impacts of EMR on wildlife 9 of 28\
exposure under normal environmental conditions which some studies did quite well. The currently biggest\
issue is the time of exposure, as long-term studies are mostly missing. The development of devices to expose\
wild animals for a long time to controlled RF in the field should be impelled (e.g. coil-collars or large coil\
systems around enclosures).\
c. Plants\
Plants are outstanding models to study the impact of EMR on biological systems. Indeed, they are immobile\
and therefore can't escape from an environmental constraint and keep a constant orientation in the EMR.\
Their high surface to volume ratio place a high proportion of cells at the direct interface of the environment\
and are deprived of awareness, thus eliminating the interference with stressful conditions that could be\
encountered with animal experiments.\
The technical aspect of the studies performed on plants ranked from very poor to excellent. The control of\
the exposure conditions is one of the most difficult to overcome. Concerning the laboratory studies, one\
could avoid the use of communication devices such as cell phones to expose sample since their automatisms\
make difficult to control the emitted EMR and the samples are placed near the device in a region where the\
EMR is not well established (near field) and difficult to control and measure.\
The studies conducted in the field are comparatively less abundant and raise two difficulties: i) the first is to\
efficiently measure the level of EMR in an open environment, where it may vary in nature and amplitude\
along the day; ii) the second is to avoid / limit or understand the interference with other environmental traits\
(wind, temperature, pathogens...) that may compromise or make difficult the interpretation of biological\
responses. The parameters that are used to report the EMR effect on plant are diverse and of unequal value.\
A high proportion of laboratory experiments concentrate on biochemical or molecular changes that occur\
shortly after sample exposure. They are using standardized protocols and are generally well conducted, but\
a greater attention should be paid to control samples. Indeed, most of biological traits vary along the day\
and changes may reflect natural events rather than responses to EMR if the proper control samples are not\
performed. Modifications of plant growth after exposure should be conducted with great care since they\
reveal delayed effects of the exposure and the experiments last for several days during which it can be\
difficult to avoid interference with other factors that could lead to misinterpretations.\
Recommendations for future lab studies could include the use of dedicated devices (TEM-Cell and G-TEM)\
that offer several advantages, particularly the ability to obtain high EMR amplitude with relatively low\
injected power, and a very good control of the electromagnetic field characteristics. These devices however\
only allow the generation of polarized EMR, a situation that is rarely encountered in the true environment,\
especially in an urban environment, were the signals are reflected and diffracted. The mode stirred\
reverberation chamber (MSRC), is designed to mimic this situation and has proven to be a very valuable tool\
as exposure device. However, the cost and complexity has limited the use of this facility.\
The field experiments are extremely interesting since plants are still witnesses of their environment and\
should report long term exposure effects in natural conditions. They are generally using an approach based\
on the observation of symptoms, linking appearance defects with exposure to electromagnetic fields. Since\
this approach could be a good starting point, the formal link between the symptoms and the exposure should\
be established with complementary laboratory studies.\
Another key recommendation would be to ensure collaboration with physicists to avoid errors in the set-up\
of the experimental procedures and/or of the exposure level measurement. \
10 of 28 eklipse-mechanism.eu\
d. General and cross-cutting observations\
The studies with the highest rankings set the benchmark for the minimal requirements a future study should\
meet to be suitable for publication in peer-reviewed journals:\
1. Data collection and/or analysis must be conducted in a blinded fashion to minimize observer bias\
2. Proper controls for side effects accompanying magnetic exposure, such as vibrations, heat and electric\
fields need to be accounted for, e.g. by using double-wrapped coils.\
3. Whenever magnetic fields are applied it needs to be made sure that all experimental groups are exposed\
to the same background field by shielding (Faraday cage). In any case the background field needs to be\
reported through continuous broadband measurements.\
4. The magnetic fields used need to be accurately measured and the measurement devices and results\
reported in detail: Sensitivity of the devices, frequency (-range), intensity, polarization, duration,\
direction\
Collaboration with physicists to better prepare and implement the technical protocols is a major aspect for\
ensuring technical quality of the studies.\
3.2 Quality of the studies in terms of biological or ecological aspects\
a. Invertebrates\
Physiological and histological studies were usually well replicated and the scientific approach in terms of\
replication and analysis of the results was satisfactory.\
There is a real lack of ecological studies looking at the effect of EMR on species assemblages. One study points\
out some guilds that seem to be less affected by EMR possibly due to different life history traits that minimise\
exposure levels at critical life stages. There are no published studies of effects of EMR on species interactions.\
From a scientific and technical perspective, the best primary studies (i.e. those receiving a score = 3) tended\
to be those reporting on the fundamental biology of interactions between insects and naturally occurring\
electromagnetic fields. Such studies were always laboratory based, well replicated and controlled. Overall\
the next tier of primary studies (graded as score 2) were more focussed on anthropogenic sources of EMR,\
such as that produced by mobile phone masts, but were mostly laboratory based. This set of studies was very\
mixed with respect to scientific quality, sometimes replication appeared at a reasonable and appropriate\
level. However, a lack or underreporting of the design, replication levels or methods sometimes meant that\
the study could not be evaluated properly. Of the few field studies, there were either negligible, contrasting\
effects on behaviour or abundance.\
The remaining field and laboratory studies (graded 0 or 1) were anecdotal or flawed from the perspective of\
scientific design, such as having very low or non-existent levels of replication, pseudoreplication, highly\
unrealistic treatments, or sometimes a combination of all flaws. Consequently, no statistical analysis can be\
done and no meaningful information can be gleaned from such studies.\
b. Vertebrates\
Readouts for effects of EMR on vertebrates span the whole spectrum from hormone levels and other\
physiological parameters to behaviour. Many of these readouts might have ecological implications (relevant\
for species survival and thus of interest for conservation efforts) but real ecological studies are extremely \
EKLIPSE \'96 Current knowledge about impacts of EMR on wildlife 11 of 28\
rare. The lack of ecological studies is most probably based on the number of environmental variables that\
effect ecological communities which makes it hard to identify the influence of EMR in a controlled manner.\
The studies focussing on single species often in a laboratory setting suffer from an additional and very general\
problem: They are not based on hypotheses of how EMR could influence biological structures and thus are\
not following hypothetico-deductive methodology. Therefore, the effects found are not explainable and no\
dose-response relationships are revealed. The exposure levels vary dramatically between studies and results\
are rarely replicated across laboratories.\
However, there are two exceptions:\
1. Heat effects: It is undisputed that strong EMR fields increase the temperature in tissue and many EMR\
effects found in (especially older) studies can explained by hyperthermia. However, the EMR intensities\
needed to induce the heating are not experienced by wildlife (so far).\
2. The magnetic sense of birds: Two main hypotheses for the transduction mechanism are supported by\
manifold evidence and the influence of EMR can be specifically predicted and tested.\
Of the 20 primary research studies rated in this assessment one quarter was of very low quality in terms of\
the biological aspects (see Appendix II - Tables with number of assessed studies). Of the rest, one half (7) was\
of mediocre quality while 8 studies where excellent, with clear hypothesis-based predictions that were\
specifically tested. 62.5% of these excellent studies were from the field of animal magnetoreception.\
c. Plants\
Angiosperms are by far the main taxonomic group to be studied (only a few used mosses).\
The principal point is to achieve a formal link between the exposure and the biological responses, thus the\
main issue is to avoid the intrusion of environmental factors that may interfere with the conclusions. This\
point is especially critical for plants since their immobility make them very sensitive to even minute changes\
(light, mineral nutrition, wind, etc.). Basically, and apart from the lab/field point of view, studies can be\
divided in two:\
1. those exposing seeds or seedlings and looking at events (biochemical and growth modifications) that\
follows the exposure. These had the advantage of using \'abnaive\'bb samples (i.e. with no or limited life\
history before the exposure) that self-feed on their reserves. They however present the disadvantage of\
incomplete metabolism and/or limited organ development that may minor interaction with EMR.\
2. older or adult plants that present the advantage of fully functional metabolism (in particular the\
photosynthetic apparatus) and well developed vegetative organs to ensure efficient EMR signal pick-up.\
These models require however careful handling and constant environmental conditions over the\
exposure, this can only be achieved effectively in the laboratory.\
While the experiments could be easily repeated in laboratory, field experiments could suffer from single\
observations that it may be difficult or impossible to observe a satisfying equivalent. These approaches\
should avoid such situation and concentrate on samples that are present similar exposure conditions and\
symptoms.\
12 of 28 eklipse-mechanism.eu\
d. General and cross-cutting observations\
Double-blind experimental procedures are ideal for exposures protocols. Anyway, special attention should\
be paid to set-up adequate controls and to properly evaluate the level of exposure. Also, the use of\
communication devices as EMR source should be avoided.\
Of the reviews, the majority are not systematic or objective but appear to be unbalanced and asserting a\
particular world view (i.e. that it is a problem for biodiversity) without strong supporting evidence.\
Cryptochromes are particularly interesting as they occur across all groups.\
3.3 Key findings: studied organisms and observed effects\
a. Invertebrates\
Organisms studied for impacts of EMR are the western honey bee (Apis mellifera), Drosophila flies, specific\
beetle species, ants and in one/few cases wild pollinators (Diptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Coleoptera).\
Few, often high quality, published experiments on the fundamental biological responses of insects to\
naturally occurring electromagnetic fields (or experimentally imposed fields closely mimicking nature or their\
lack) demonstrate how insects detect and orientate with electrical or magnetic fields and the effects (or lack\
of) on behaviour, physiological function, reproduction. While providing some mechanistic basis for\
hypothesis testing, such studies do not provide evidence on effects of anthropogenic sources of EMR on\
invertebrate biodiversity.\
The majority of laboratory studies are focussed on physiological or developmental responses to short-term\
or acute exposure to experimental sources of EMR. There are no studies that examine effects on\
invertebrates of long-term or chronic exposure to sources of anthropogenic EMR.\
Effects on insects tend to be often complex, typically variable in direction or effect size, and only sometimes\
adverse. Of the few scientifically rigorous laboratory experiments on model species (i.e. Drosophila) there is\
some evidence of exposure leading to cell damage or effects on individual development, locomotion, or\
reproduction.\
There is a dearth of evidence from scientifically robust field studies, those that are available range from\
deeply flawed investigations that provide no meaningful evidence to a very restricted number of relatively\
robust studies albeit of limited scope. Of the latter, there have been studies that have shown some evidence\
that close proximity to EMR (from mobile phones) can affect honey bee colony behaviour, that exposure to\
mobile phone antennas can elicit idiosyncratic effects on wild pollinator abundance according to taxon, and\
no effects on reproductive capacity.\
b. Vertebrates\
In vertebrates, there is not much agreement on the effect of EMR on ecologically relevant parameters.\
Studies reporting effects are approximately as frequent as those reporting no effects (50-50%).\
Few studies exist on direct ecological effects such as species abundance near RF-towers or in cities where\
background EMR levels are elevated. The descriptive nature of the studies, however, makes it impossible to\
detangle real EMR effects from other confounders such as light-pollution. There is some evidence that \
EKLIPSE \'96 Current knowledge about impacts of EMR on wildlife 13 of 28\
animals might avoid strong radiation sources such as radar and mobile phone towers but the few studies do\
not allow drawing definite conclusions about ecological implications.\
Studies on physiological effects lack theoretical foundation which makes them appear as shots in the dark, a\
scientific practice which is prone to type I errors (finding effects that are not real). The reported findings\
range from effects on redox reactions and hormone levels to altered nociception and growth rates and\
malformations during (embryonic) development. Of these, a reducing effect of repeated exposure to a zero\
magnetic field on nociception seems to be the most established finding, even though completely\
independent replications are still needed. While many of the observed effects might be real, only strict\
hypothesis driven research based on a priori established theoretical models will eventually help to identify\
the RF real effects and the mechanisms underlying them. Dose-effect relationships are missing but as a rule,\
longer exposures where more often reported to have an effect. Birds comprise the most studied group of\
vertebrates followed by small rodents such as mice and rabbits. In sum, the findings of RF influence on\
physiological parameters in vertebrates can be described as contradictory and inconclusive.\
By the far the most advanced theoretical foundation concerns the effects of RF fields on magnetic orientation\
migratory birds. Currently, there is strong evidence that the sensor is based on radical pair intermediates\
(perhaps in a protein called Cryptochrome) which are naturally sensitive to magnetic fields in the\
radiofrequency range. It is established that the magnetic compass of migratory birds can be disrupted by the\
weak RF background in larger cities (nT-intensities) but it is currently unclear which exact frequencies are\
most effective. Furthermore, some studies have suggested that fields emanating from power lines also affect\
the magnetic sense of vertebrates but again it is unclear whether this is effect is specific to 50Hz-MF or to\
harmonics or even electric fields. More and more evidence is accumulating that mammals (e.g. bats and\
mice) have a magnetic sense which might be based on radical-pairs and as such will likewise be affected by\
RF. It remains to be tested whether disruption of a magnetic compass has real ecological consequences as\
animals make use of a variety of mechanisms for orientation.\
c. Plants\
Mainly Angiosperms. Significant changes have been demonstrated at cellular and molecular levels. Changes\
in oxidative metabolism are quite often reported~: increase in peroxidase activity, membrane state. Exposure\
to low level of 900 MHz (10 min, 5 V/m) caused a rapid increase in stress-related transcript accumulation in\
tomato. The role of calcium has been characterized in this model by using chelators and by measuring the\
calmodulin gene expression. Calcium and a normal behaviour of the plant hormone abscisic acid are required\
to achieve the stress-related transcripts accumulation that occurred in a systemic way in plants; the energy\
metabolism is also transiently affected (about 30%). The genotoxicity of EMR is also questioned in some\
article. However additional data are still needed here since these methods could easily bring false positives.\
Terpene emission was reported to be enhanced by EMR and could also be considered as a marker of stress\
perception.\
The metabolic and/or gene expression changes were not always related to changes in plant growth and\
development. It is however an excellent way to realize the integration of the EMR perception and responses\
in the development of the organism. However, several articles report impact on plants growth and\
development after exposure to EMR. The growth was reported to be reduced, either soon after the exposure\
or after a delay of several days, when new organs are created.\
14 of 28 eklipse-mechanism.eu\
3.4 Knowledge gaps and research needs\
a. Invertebrates\
There is a dire need for more ecological studies, which measure the effects of EMR on wild communities.\
Studies which measure the community responses (abundance, diversity and ecosystem functioning) longterm and ideally pre- and post-exposure would be especially valuable. In order for such studies to be\
conclusive they would have to be carried out over a wide geographical extent and in different natural and\
anthropogenic systems. In addition, interdisciplinary collaborations that test hypotheses drawing on what is\
known about insect physiology to test probable biological and ecological impacts (and avoid speculative adhoc approach) at field-realistic exposure could give important insights.\
We also need studies that assess chronic effects, as these are more likely to be occurring, as well as\
experiments that examine the potential interplay between EMR exposure and a) foraging ecology and b)\
other stressors (e.g. pathogens, environmental pollutants/chemicals) affecting nutritional ecology.\
b. Vertebrates\
In the field of animal magnetic navigation, knowledge about the definite receptor mechanism mediating the\
perception of the Earth\'92s magnetic field will greatly facilitate the assessment of the effect of man-made\
magnetic fields on the ecology of wild migrants. Along the same lines, if it turns out that the receptors are\
also present in non-migratory species, but that they might fulfil a different function (e.g. in circadian rhythms\
in case of Cryptochromes) it will need to be assessed whether it still retained remnant magnetosensitivity\
that might be responsible for physiological effects of man-made magnetic field on organisms.\
Studies on the effects on long-term exposure (e.g. throughout development) are needed.\
Furthermore, real ecological studies are missing. Do electromagnetic fields have an effect on species\
populations? In order to reduce confounding effects of other factors, such studies should be performed on\
small vertebrates with fast reproduction rates under highly controlled conditions in outdoor enclosures as\
well as on whole communities using gigantic coils or antenna systems or perform meta-analyses on\
established data-sets by taking RF-data into account. To enable such studies in future, the establishment of\
fixed RF-measurement stations (e.g. at already established geomagnetic observatories) would be beneficial.\
c. Plants\
There is the need to improve the quality of the exposure system: to stop using telecom devices and prefer\
TEM/G-TEM cells and other well-defined devices.\
Also, to use reliable markers (enzymatic and/or gene expression) which are both inexpensive and allow to\
report changes in the behaviour of plants. These markers also bring valuable information of molecular events\
that occur shortly after exposure. They also allow a better link with the exposure than growth studies that\
may integrate environmental signals other than EMR, leading to misinterpretations.\
Ideally, these biochemical/molecular studies should be completed by growth studies to assess changes at the\
scale of the whole plant. Field experiments should this way relate symptoms observed to\
biological/molecular changes.\

\f0\fs24 \cf0 Artificial light pollution: are shifting spectral signatures\
changing the balance of species interactions?\
\
Abstract\
Technological developments in municipal lighting are altering the spectral characteristics of artificially lit habitats.\
Little is yet known of the biological consequences of such changes, although a variety of animal behaviours are\
dependent on detecting the spectral signature of light reflected from objects. Using previously published wavelengths\
of peak visual pigment absorbance, we compared how four alternative street lamp technologies affect the visual abilities of 213 species of arachnid, insect, bird, reptile and mammal by producing different wavelength ranges of light to\
which they are visually sensitive. The proportion of the visually detectable region of the light spectrum emitted by\
each lamp was compared to provide an indication of how different technologies are likely to facilitate visually guided\
behaviours such as detecting objects in the environment. Compared to narrow spectrum lamps, broad spectrum technologies enable animals to detect objects that reflect light over more of the spectrum to which they are sensitive and,\
importantly, create greater disparities in this ability between major taxonomic groups. The introduction of broad\
spectrum street lamps could therefore alter the balance of species interactions in the artificially lit environment.\

Introduction\
Artificial lights have been used to illuminate the nighttime environment for over a century, during which\
numerous alternative lighting technologies have arisen,\
each emitting light with unique spectral characteristics\
(Elvidge et al., 2010). Now widely distributed, artificial\
lighting is spreading at a rate of 6% per year globally\
(Holker \'80 et al., 2010). Indeed, by 2001 it was estimated\
that the fraction of land under skies that were artificially brightened above natural background levels\
already exceeded 10% in 66 nations across the planet\
(Cinzano et al., 2001). Organisms have evolved under\
the intensities, timings and spectral composition of\
light emitted from the sun and stars, and reflected from\
the moon. However, artificial lighting is changing all\
these aspects of natural light regimes (Gaston et al.,\
2012) leading to a potentially diverse array of ecological\
impacts (Longcore & Rich, 2004; Perkin et al., 2011;\
Gaston et al., 2013). A recent surge in research activity\
has revealed that artificially lighting the nocturnal environment can have impacts ranging from changes in\
animal behaviour (Rydell, 1992; Bird et al., 2004; Eisenbeis, 2006; Stone et al., 2009; Titulaer et al., 2012) to the\
composition of whole communities (Davies et al., 2012).\
Yet, because artificial light pollution has only recently\
become widely recognized as an environmental issue,\
studies on its ecological effects remain relatively scarce.\
Since the second half of the 20th century, narrow\
spectrum Low Pressure Sodium (LPS) lighting, with a\
characteristic orange hue, has been the most common\
form of street lighting in many regions. However,\
ongoing advances in street lighting technology have led\
to the increasing adoption of broader spectrum light\
sources such as High Pressure Sodium (HPS), Light\
Emitting Diode (LED) and Metal Halide (MH) lamps\
(Elvidge et al., 2010), which provide improved colour\
rendering capabilities for humans. Shifting and broadening the spectra of street lamps may lead to unforeseen environmental impacts because the spectral\
signature reflected from objects is an important cue that\
guides a number of animal behaviours, including, for\
example, the detection of resources (Chittka et al., 1994;\
Hempel de Ibarra & Vorobyev, 2009; Macedonia et al.,\
2009; Chiao et al., 2011; Zou et al., 2011), mate selection\
(Andersson et al., 1998; Hunt et al., 2001; Robertson &\
Monteiro, 2005; Lim et al., 2008) and navigation (Cheng\
et al., 1986; Moller, 2002; Mappes & Homberg, 2004; \'80\
Reppert et al., 2004; Ugolini et al., 2005). Here, we ask\
whether the use of broad spectrum street lighting technologies is likely to improve the ability of animals to\
perform tasks during the night which are guided by the\
detection of light reflected from objects, and whether\
this could alter the balance of species interactions.\

Materials and methods\
Overview\
We based our analysis on a novel collation of previously published wavelengths at which the visual pigments contained\
within the photoreceptors of 213 species of animal (comprising 7 arachnids, 112 insects, 16 birds, 32 reptiles and 46 mammals) maximally absorb light (kmax) (see Table S1). Using a\
previously derived formula which describes the absorbance\
properties of visual pigments based on their kmax (see Govardovskii et al., 2000 for details), we then modelled the absorbance of the visual pigments in each species from 200 to\
750 nm and estimated the maximum (maxk0.5) and minimum\
(mink0.5) wavelengths of half maximum absorbance (Fig. 1) to\
determine the range of wavelengths detectable by each species\
(k0.5 range). By comparing the region of the light spectrum\
over which LPS, HPS, LED and MH lamps emit light (klight\
range) with the region of the light spectrum over which the\
visual pigments in animal eyes absorb more than half of the\
light passing through them (k0.5 range), we obtained a value of\
the proportion of the visually detectable wavelength range at\
greater than half maximum absorbance which is stimulated by\
each type of street lamp (% k0.5 range). By way of example,\
Fig. 1 illustrates how the % k0.5 range of the visual system in\
humans relates to the objects we can detect in the environment\
under each type of street lamp. LPS lamps emit light over a\
narrow region of the light spectrum to which human photoreceptors are sensitive, hence objects that reflect light mainly\
outside this region appear dim or are not seen at all. HPS,\
LED and MH lamps emit light over a greater proportion of the\
light spectrum to which humans are sensitive (Fig. 1), hence\
more objects are easily detected under these lighting technologies because they are better discriminated in colour and\
brightness. The % k0.5 range is a useful comparative index of\
the ability of animals to detect light reflected from ecologically\
relevant objects in their environment, because it represents the\
proportion of the visually detectable region of the light\
spectrum illuminated by a light source.\
Values of % k0.5 range were compared both between lighting technologies within each animal class, and between animal\
classes within each lighting technology using Markov Chain\
Monte Carlo regression (see below). To aid the interpretation\
of any patterns observed in the data, we also estimated the\
average maximum and minimum wavelengths at which the\
visual pigments of each animal group absorb more than half\
of the light entering the photoreceptor (max k0.5 and min k0.5)\
(Fig. 2a).\
Data collection (a) visual pigment kmax\
Values of photoreceptor visual pigment kmax were collected\
for 248 species of animal through an extensive literature\
search (see Table S1), and used to model the a and the b absorbance curves of the corresponding visual pigments using a\
standard formula (Govardovskii et al., 2000). Values of min\
k0.5, max k0.5 and k0.5 range were then calculated for each of\
the 213 species. The remaining 35 species were omitted from\
the analysis due to missing values of kmax for the visual\
pigments of known photoreceptors. For example, while the\
majority of insects possess UV photoreceptor cells, they have\
not been characterized in every studied species due to technological limitations (Bernard & Stavenga, 1979; Peitsch et al.,\
1992; Briscoe & Chittka, 2001). In species of insect for which\
the spectral sensitivity functions were available separately for\
females and males, either the sex for which fewer visual pigment kmax wavelengths were quantified was omitted from the\
analysis, or if the number of visual pigments quantified was\
identical between sexes the male was omitted from the\
analysis. New World primates of the same species can be\
either dichromatic or trichromatic (Jacobs & Deegan, 2003). To\
prevent duplicating results for any one species, it was\
assumed that all individuals of each polymorphic species\
were trichromatic. The short, medium and long wave sensitive\
photoreceptors of birds and some diurnal reptiles are associated with oil droplets which alter the transmittance of light to\
the visual pigment and change the maximum wavelengths at\
which these pigments half maximally absorb light (UV\
sensitive photoreceptors and all photoreceptors in nocturnal\
reptiles possess clear oil droplets which do not affect the transmittance of light to the visual pigment; e.g., Hart & Vorobyev,\
2005). For the birds and diurnal reptiles, changes in the absorbance curves of short, medium and long wavelength photoreceptors due to oil droplet transmittance were modelled prior\
to the estimation of min k0.5 and max k0.5 using the method\
outlined by Hart & Vorobyev (2005) and published values of\
oil droplet cut-off wavelengths (kcut) or wavelengths at half\
maximum absorbance (kmid) (see Table S1). In a few species,\
lens absorption produces a cut-off effect slightly limiting the\
visual range, but it has not been measured widely across\
species, therefore it was not included.\
Data collection (b) light spectra\
The spectral compositions of four glass housed street lamps,\
one representative of each of the LPS (35W Thorn Beta 5\
installed 12/2009), HPS (250W ZX3, Urbis installed 07/\
2008), LED (120W Ledway, Ruud installed 11/2010) and\
MH (45W Evolo lantern, Urbis installed 12/2009) technologies, were collected from municipal lighting installations in\
Cornwall, UK. While some variation exists in the exact\
spectra emitted by different makes and models of each\
technology, our selection was representative of the common\
differences between these technologies (narrow vs. broad\
spectrum, and UV vs. non-UV emissive). Light spectra were\
quantified using a MAYA2000-Pro spectrometer collecting\
light from a CC-3-UV-S cosine corrector connected via a\
1000 lm fibre optic cable (Ocean Optics). The cosine corrector was held at ground level during measurements to capture the light spectra that most animals are likely to be\
exposed to. The resulting light spectra were used to quantify\
the region over which each lamp technology emits light\
(klight range).\
Data analysis\
Photoreceptor signals are mainly determined by the maximum absorption of the photopigment at the wavelength kmax,\
\'a9 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Global Change Biology, 19, 1417\'961423\
1418 T. W. DAVIES et al.\
and a photoreceptor\'92s sensitivity decreases steeply with\
increasing distance from this peak sensitivity wavelength\
(Fig. 1). Visual systems have mostly evolved sets of receptors\
where sensitivities are well separated to avoid overlapping\
within the receptor\'92s most sensitive range, usually between\
the half maximally sensitive (k0.5) and kmax. Such spacing of\
photoreceptor sensitivities enables the effective coding of colours and increases an animal\'92s ability to discriminate and\
recognize colours. Visual performance is influenced to a much\
lesser extent by the absorption of light in the low-sensitivity\
wavelength range. Therefore, the region of the light spectrum\
to which each species is more than half maximally sensitive\
(k0.5 range) was determined as the visual range. The\
percentage of k0.5 range stimulated by each street lamp\
technology (% k0.5 range) was then estimated as the fraction of\
the k0.5 range overlapped by the klight range (Fig. 1).\
Means and 95% credibility interval values of min k0.5, max\
k0.5 and % k0.5 range were estimated for each animal class perceiving light emitted from each type of street lamp using zero\
intercept Markov Chain Monte Carlo regression (MCMCregress; CRAN: MCMCpack; Martin et al., 2010) (1001 : 11000\
iterations). Means and 95% credibility intervals of the difference in % k0.5 range between street lamp types were estimated\
separately for each animal class, and separately for each street\
lamp type when comparing between animal classes, using\
MCMC regression with a fitted intercept (1001 : 11000 iterations). The resulting pairwise comparisons were interpreted in\
a manner analogous to parametric pairwise comparison tests.\
Where the credibility intervals of the difference between two\
street lamp types or animal classes did not bound 0, there is a\
95% probability that they are different.\
Results\
The results indicate that the four street lighting technologies can be divided into three categories based on how\
likely they are to facilitate the detection of objects\
reflecting light in different regions of the spectrum\
(Table 1; Fig. 2b): narrow spectrum lamps which do\
not emit UV light (LPS), broad spectrum lamps which\
do not emit UV light (HPS and LED) and broad spectrum lamps which do emit UV light (MH). There was a\
greater than 95% probability that the narrow spectral\
range of light emitted by LPS lamps stimulated the\

smallest proportion of the light spectrum to which animals are sensitive (Table 1) spanning from 5  3.66%\
k0.5 range in the arachnids to 13.1  2.4% k0.5 range in\
the birds (Fig. 2b). Metal Halide (MH) lamps stimulated the largest proportion of the light spectrum to\
which animals are sensitive spanning from 77.9  5.4%\
k0.5 range in the arachnids to 97.1  2.1% k0.5 range in\
the mammals (Fig. 2b). There was a greater than 95%\
probability that MH lamps stimulated a larger percentage of the k0.5 range than each of the remaining lighting\
technologies (Table 1). HPS and LED lighting technologies stimulate similar percentages of the k0.5 range in all\
classes of animal studied (Table 1). The broad emission\
spectra of these technologies stimulate a higher percentage of the k0.5 range in comparison to LPS lamps\
with greater than 95% probability (Table 1) in all five\
animal classes, but to a lesser extent than MH lamps\
(Table 1; Fig. 2b).\
In addition to changing the ability of animals to\
detect light reflected from objects in general, the contrasting lighting technologies also affected the comparative ability of different taxonomic groups to detect\
light reflected from objects. LPS lamps stimulate more\
of the k0.5 range of birds and mammals compared to\
arachnids, insects and reptiles with greater than 95%\
probability (Fig. 2b; Table 2). HPS, LED and MH lights,\
however, increase the number and magnitude of\
differences in % k0.5 range between animal classes with\
a greater than 95% probability (Table 2). These differences are greatest between the mammals and the\
remaining animal classes under LED and HPS lamp\
types (Table 2) because mammals detect light over a\
narrower region of the light spectrum (Fig. 2a). Similarly, the k0.5 range of birds extends less into the shorter\
wavelengths compared to insects, arachnids and reptiles (Fig. 2a), hence there was a greater than 95% probability that a higher percentage of the light spectrum\
detected by birds is stimulated under HPS, LED and\
MH lamps (Table 2).\

Our results suggest that the installation of broader\
spectrum lighting technologies in artificially lit habitats\

is likely to improve the ability of animals to detect light\
reflected from objects in their environment at night,\
and has the potential to generate greater disparities in\
this ability between different classes of animal. These\
improvements in object detection under broad spectrum street lights are likely to affect the execution of\
visually guided behaviours in animals, altering their\
normal activity times and spatially extending or fragmenting habitats. All three broad spectrum lighting\
technologies provided significant improvements in the\
% k0.5 range in comparison to narrow spectrum LPS\
lamps. MH lamps provided the greatest improvements\
in all five taxonomic classes. Hence, where these are in\
use, a greater variety of objects reflecting light in different regions of the light spectrum will appear brighter\
and more colourful to animals compared with alternative street lamp technologies. While LPS lamps illuminate objects reflecting light across the smallest region of\
the light spectrum, our results suggest that in areas illuminated by LPS lamps, birds and mammals are better\
able to detect objects that reflect light in this region\
compared to arachnids, insects and reptiles. The introduction of broader spectrum technologies, however,\
increases the number, and the magnitude of the differences between animal classes, in the proportion of the\
visually detectable light spectrum illuminated, with\
mammals and birds displaying the largest improvements. Most mammals possess dichromatic vision\
spanning a less extended range of the light spectrum in\
comparison to birds, reptiles, arachnids and insects\
(Fig. 2a; see Table S1) that typically can detect light at\
wavelengths below 400 nm (UV) (Tovee, 1995; Briscoe\
& Chittka, 2001; Hart & Hunt, 2007; Osorio & Vorobyev, 2008). Birds do possess UV sensitive photoreceptors, but their sensitivity extends less into the shorter\
wavelengths compared to insects, arachnids and reptiles (Fig. 2a). Broad spectrum lamp types therefore\
stimulate a larger percentage of the k0.5 range in mammals and birds in general, compared with other classes\
of animal, improving their ability to perform visually\
guided behaviours with greater acuity and potentially\
upsetting the balance of interspecific interactions.\
Our results provide an overview of how shifting artificial light spectra are likely to affect visually guided\
behaviours in broad taxonomic groups of animal. However, the k0.5 range of individual species can be variable\
within each taxonomic group, and therefore caution\
should be exercised when applying the results of a\
group in general to any one specific species within that\
group. For example, the number of photoreceptor types\
in insect eyes is variable between different orders\
(Table S1) giving rise to variation in the proportion of\
k0.5 range illuminated by each type of artificial light. In\
addition, the number of species for which kmax values\
are available in the literature varies between taxonomic\
groups (Table S1), and while the main results of this\

study are unlikely to be affected, the k0.5 range will\
inevitably adjust as data become available for more species and additional photoreceptors in those groups\
which are not currently well investigated (for example\
the arachnids). These results are not therefore conclusive, rather they should be considered as a platform of\
predictions which incentivises further studies into the\
impact of broadening artificial light spectra on visually\
guided behaviours in animals.\
The ecological impacts of artificially lighting the nocturnal environment are increasingly being recognized\
(Frank, 2006; Stone et al., 2012; Titulaer et al., 2012),\
with some studies drawing attention to the potential\
impact of shifting spectral signatures (Eisenbeis, 2006;\
Stone et al., 2012). This study has highlighted that such\
changes may be affecting visually guided behaviours in\
species across the animal kingdom. The range of potential impacts are diverse and may include extending the\
times of foraging and sexual competition of diurnal and\
crepuscular animals into the night (Robertson & Monteiro, 2005; Somanathan et al., 2009; Titulaer et al., 2012),\
improving both prey detection and predator avoidance\
(Roth & Kelber, 2004), changing the ability of organisms\
to navigate around their environment (Warrant et al.,\
2004, Somanathan et al., 2008; Stone et al., 2009; van\
Langevelde et al., 2011) and affecting the ability of pollinating species to detect nectar resources (Kelber et al.,\
2002; Hempel de Ibarra & Vorobyev, 2009). Whether\
broadening artificial light spectra will elicit positive or\
negative species responses is likely to depend on the\
species and the behaviour being considered. For example, the presence of LED lighting increases feeding rates\
in nesting Great Tits Parus major (Titulaer et al., 2012),\
while the bat Rhinolophus hipposideros avoids areas lit by\
HPS and LED lighting (Stone et al., 2009, 2012) potentially due to perceived predation risk (Rydell, 1992).\
Metal Halide (MH) lamps are likely to provide the largest improvements in animal vision because they emit\
light that is both broad and contains UV in its spectral\
composition. Many of the above tasks depend on the\
perception of UV light reflected from objects by animals\
that can detect light at these wavelengths. Hence, the\
introduction of broader spectrum lighting technologies\
containing UV may have more profound consequences\
for biological systems than non-UV broad spectrum\
lighting technologies. All three broad spectrum technologies, however, create larger disparities in % k0.5\
between animal groups compared with narrow spectrum LPS lamps, and so have greater potential to alter\
the balance of interspecific interactions in the environment. Evaluating the direct environmental impacts of\
each of these different lamp types is clearly essential in\
a world where the artificially lit night-time environment is increasingly becoming \'91white\'92.}{\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252\cocoartf2577

\f0\fs24 \cf0 Which animals can see the most extreme wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation - i.e. whose eyes are sensitive furthest into the UV or IR spectrum?\
I'm also interested in any "special" senses that animals have, in a similar vein to birds' ability to sense magnetic fields. \

The question has no simple answer. As for the UV sensitivity as such, many animals see what human call UV. Rod and cone visual pigments are inherently highly sensitive to the UV, down to 280 nm. The UV sensitivity is higher that in the "official" visible range beyond ca. 590 nm ("yellow"). Humans do not see it because the wavelengths <400 nm are heavily absorbed by the lens and the yellow pigment in the retina. In many (most?) animals, however, eye media are UV-transparent, so they can see the (human) UV. A simplest example is a mouse or a frog.\
The question is, what could be use of this sensitivity in natural condition. There apparently are no specific UV sources in nature, and the signal from the "visible" part of the spectrum overwhelms the weak UV component. In old times, quartz or UV-transparent plastic artificial lenses were used for cataract surgery. Then a person could see more vivid blue colors, and some were able to recognize a pale UV-dark pattern in some flowers, invisible to a normal observer. Not a big gain, I suppose.\
On the other hand, many animals have specific UV-sensitive photoreceptors (cones in vertebrates). Their visual pigments do not absorb beyond ca. 400 nm, so there is no signal from the human "visible" band that could interfere with selective processing of the UV.  Among mammals, rodents have UV-cones. In vertebrates in general, UV-cones are present in many fish and amphibians, perhaps in majority of reptiles, and probably in all birds. Many insects also possess them. So possessing specific UV-sensitive photoreceptors is rather a rule than an exception.Typically, spectral sensitivity of these cells are around 360 nm, and they can provide a useful signal within the entire range of transparency of their ocular media, typically down to ~320 nm.\
As for the sensitivity to the long-wave part of the spectrum (human IR), many fish (usually fresh-water) may have cones with maximum sensitivity at ~620 nm, compared to human 565 nm. In addition, the sensitivity band in fish pigment is a bit wider that in human, so fish visible spectrum is extended to the (human) IR by ca. 100 nm. There were reports on even more red-sensitive photoreceptors in some butterflies, but it is not firmly established. Anyway, there probably are no animals that could use their eyes to see a prey or a predator in its own thermal radiation.\

For UV receptors many investigators have described peaks ~360 nm in vertebrates (e.g. Bow maker et al Vis Res 37: 2183-2194; Robinson et al PNAS 90: 6009-6012; Loew et al Vis Neuroscience 13: 247-256).  In Limulus, the UV-VIS receptor has a peak ~348 nm (Battelle et al J Exp Biol 217: 3133-3145 (2014))\
A variety of plants have UV-B sensitivity that is used for signaling in plants (e.g. Hoffman The Plant Cell September 2012 24:3485)\
Other "special" sensitivities include echolocation; infrasound (low frequency) detection of whales and elephants, detection of polarized light (see Horv\'e1th, G., & Varj\'fa, D. (2004). Polarized light in animal vision: polarization patterns in nature. Springer Science & Business Media.)\
Many fish are extremely sensitive to electric currents through their lateral line detectors or rostrum detectors that is used for prey detection, navigation, or schooling (see e.g. Neiman, A., Pei, X., Russell, D., Wojtenek, W., Wilkens, L., Moss, F., ... & Voigt, K. (1999). Synchronization of the noisy electrosensitive cells in the paddlefish. Physical Review Letters, 82(3), 660.  One extreme example in the paddlefish that can detect 1/100,000,000 of a volt per centimeter.\

More on "exotic" senses:\
The ability to discriminate light polarization patterns is widespread outside vertebrates. Perhaps all arthropods (insects, spiders, crayfish etc) possess it, and squids and octopuses also do it quite well. Funny, but among vertebrates just  a few species of small fish, anchoa, are known to have a specific retinal design to discriminate polarization.\
Rattlesnake and a few other species of snakes have the pit organ, a thermal locator that allows detecting a worm-blooded prey, like a rabbit, in complete darkness, by sensing its thermal radiation.\
As for electroreceptive fish, some are extremely sensitive to electric fields, as mentioned by Carl. Most sensitive are "primitive" fish like sharks, skates, and sturgeons. The electric sensitivity allows them to detect mutual motion of water, fish body, and the Earth magnetic field. This would allow to organize compass orientation, and sense remote water movements and magnetic storms (for whatever needs).\

For extreme short wave sensitivity there are experiments showing Thrips (insect) responding to light around below 300 nm (Carlos A. Mazza, Miriam M. Izaguirre, Javier Curiale, Carlos L. Ballar\'e9 2015.  look into the invisible: ultraviolet-B sensitivity in an insect (Caliothrips phaseoli) revealed through a behavioural action spectrum. Proc. Soc. Lond. B 282A). \
For long wavelength sensitivity I would consider the Dragonfish using chlorophyl to alter the spectral sensitivity of long wave sensitive photoreceptors.}{\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252\cocoartf2577

\f0\fs24 \cf0 Possible Electromagnetic Effects on Abnormal Animal Behavior Before an Earthquake\
by Masashi Hayakawa 1,2,3\
\
\
Simple Summary\
Possible electromagnetic effects on abnormal animal behavior before earthquakes.\
Abstract\
The former statistical properties summarized by Rikitake (1998) on unusual animal behavior before an earthquake (EQ) have first been presented by using two parameters (epicentral distance (D) of an anomaly and its precursor (or lead) time (T)). Three plots are utilized to characterize the unusual animal behavior; (i) EQ magnitude (M) versus D, (ii) log T versus M, and (iii) occurrence histogram of log T. These plots are compared with the corresponding plots for different seismo-electromagnetic effects (radio emissions in different frequency ranges, seismo-atmospheric and -ionospheric perturbations) extensively obtained during the last 15\'9620 years. From the results of comparisons in terms of three plots, it is likely that lower frequency (ULF (ultra-low-frequency, f \uc0\u8804  1 Hz) and ELF (extremely-low-frequency, f \u8804  a few hundreds Hz)) electromagnetic emissions exhibit a very similar temporal evolution with that of abnormal animal behavior. It is also suggested that a quantity of field intensity multiplied by the persistent time (or duration) of noise would play the primary role in abnormal animal behavior before an EQ.\
Keywords: abnormal animal behavior; earthquakes; seismogenic electromagnetic emissions\
1. Introduction\
It is widely reported that land animals, birds, fish etc. often respond to earthquakes (EQs). A considerable number of books and papers have been published on this unusual biological behavior prior to EQs (e.g., [1,2,3,4]). Such abnormal animal behavior include: (i) disappearance of rats from a house; (ii) birds crying, etc. In addition to these publications, we can add recent works on this topic from the last 10 years or so [5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]. The papers [7,8] have focused on the abnormal animal behavior for two disastrous EQs (Kobe and Wenchun EQs). These abnormal animal responses are generally called \'93macroscopic\'94 anomalies of EQs, which are mainly based on anecdotal and retrospective records of animal behavior. Their studies enable us to deduce some physical insight into why and how animals react precursorily to seismic events. In his well-documented book, Rikitake (1998) [4] concluded that one of the most probable mechanisms of biological anomalies seems to be electromagnetic effects. On the other hand, electromagnetic phenomena associated with EQs (sometimes called seismo-electromagnetics) have been extensively investigated during the last 15\'9620 years for the sake of short-term EQ prediction, and the long-term observations have enabled us to yield some statistical results on different electromagnetic effects (e.g., [13,14]).\
In this paper we first present some statistical conclusions by Rikitake (1998) [4] on macroscopic phenomena and then present recent statistical summaries of seismo-electromagnetic effects. Then we try to compare them in order to obtain some indication on the possible electromagnetic effects on biological systems before EQs. Finally we suggest that lower frequency (especially ULF (ultra-low-frequency, f \uc0\u8804  1 Hz) and ELF (extremely low frequency, f \u8804  1 kHz) seismogenic emissions, often recorded before an EQ, would be the most promising candidate to explain such unusual biological behavior.\
2. Unusual Animal Behavior Before an EQ\
In his book on \'93The science of macro-anomaly precursory to an earthquake\'94, Rikitake (1998) [4] summarized the behavior of animals (small and large), birds etc. on the basis of his extensive retrospective analyses for six large EQs including: (i) Ansei-Tokai EQ (M = 8.4, 1854); (ii) Nobi EQ (M = 8.0, 1891); (iii) Kanto EQ (M = 7.9, 1923); (iv) Toh-nankai EQ (M = 7.9, 1944); (v) Izu-oshima off-sea EQ (M = 7.0, 1978); and (vi) Miyagi-oki EQ (M = 7.4, 1978); and also publications by Kayano (1983, 1984) [15,16] on two EQs (Ibaraki-ken Nanbu EQ (M = 6.0, 1978) and Nagano-ken seibu EQ (M = 6.8, 1984)). His summary is presented in terms of two parameters: (1) distance of anomaly from the epicenter (D); and (2) precursory (or lead) time (T).\
The statistical results of the macroscopic phenomena are presented in the following three common ways: (i) the relationship of the anomaly between the EQ magnitude (M) and the epicentral distance D; (ii) log T (in units of days) versus M; and (iii) the distribution of log T. Since the magnitude M is essentially a logarithmic scale, Figure 1 illustrates the log-log relation of abnormal animal behavior (among different macroscopic phenomena) between M and D [4]. Animals mean here dogs, cats and so on. This figure indicates a tendency that, for larger M values, the precursory anomalous of animal behavior is observed farther from the epicenter of a future EQ. The straight line in the figure\'97which traces the averaged relation between M-log D on the basis of various types of macroscopic effects (including animals, birds, fish, etc.) [4]\'97is expressed by\
M = 1.86 + 2.6 log D	(1)\
Figure 2 summarizes the precursor time (T) versus M relation. The value of T is distributed over a range from a few minutes to hundreds of days for any specific M. This suggests that there is no clear relationship between T and M. However, the occurrence histogram of log T (in units of days) in Figure 3 indicates that the distribution of T is concentrated in a range of T = 1\'9610 days.\

Animals 03 00019 g003 550Figure 3. Occurrence histogram of time T (in units of days) of reported unusual animal behavior. Adapted from Rikitake (1998) [4] with permission of the publisher.\
Rikitake [4] added another informative statement. In response to the question whether there are any differences in the unusual behaviors between large and small animals, he reports that smaller animals seem to react earlier than larger animals. With respect to birds and fish, Rikitake [4] concluded that nearly all distribution of their unusual behavior is similar to those shown in Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3. Similar results have been reported for snakes, earthworms, insects, etc.\
As is seen from Figure 1 and Figure 2, Rikitake [4] did his analysis for relatively large EQs with M \uc0\u8805  7.0 because of the specific nature of the macroscopic pre-EQ anomalies. It is highly likely that the macroscopic data for lower M EQs would include more inaccurate information (or noise) to the macroscopic data for lower M values. At the same time, we need to emphasize here that most data on electromagnetic phenomena presented below were collected for M values smaller than 7 except for a few data on ULF emission, which tends to occur only for large EQs with M larger than 6\'967.\
3. Possible Sensory Mechanism of Animals\
First of all, it seems highly plausible that animals behave unusually prior to EQs, Therefore, as the next step we have to ask what kind of stimuli are likely to lead to unusual animal behavior. Based on the extensive previous studies by Evernden (1976) [1], Buskirk et al. (1981) [2], Tributsch (1982) [3], and Rikitake [4], the following is a list of possible candidates of EQ precursory phenomena acting as stimuli:\
(1)\
Change in atmospheric pressure\
(2)\
Change in gravity\
(3)\
Ground deformation (ground uplift and tilt change)\
(4)\
Acoustic signals and vibrations due to the generation of microcracks\
(5)\
Electromagnetic effects\
(6)\
Ground water level change\
(7)\
Emanation of gases and chemical substances\
Based on the available evidence, Rikitake [4] concluded that the most probable candidate for abnormal animal behavior might be (5) electromagnetic effects, though some others, for example (4) and (7), cannot be ruled out. Recently Grant et al. [12] have discussed the effect of item (7).\
4. Electromagnetic Effects and their Statistical Properties\
The history of the study of seismogenic electromagnetic effects is rather short, on the order of a few decades, but there has been much progress with respect to short-term EQ prediction, especially since the 1995 Kobe EQ (e.g., see books [13,14,17,18,19,20] or review papers [21,22]). The observation of seismogenic effects can be customarily classified into two categories: (1) direct effect of electromagnetic emissions from within the lithosphere; and (2) indirect effects in the atmosphere or ionosphere. The summaries of different phenomena belonging to both categories will be discussed one by one in relation to the previous three common relationships of M versus D, T versus M, and occurrence histogram of T.\
4.1. Seismogenic Radio Emissions\
4.1.1. DC Geoelectric Field\
Based on long-term observations in Greece, Varotsos (2005) [23] has summarized his observation of SES (Seismic Electric Signal) activity; SES activity can frequently be detected in a short time interval of the order of one day. Large EQs then tend to take place about four weeks after such SES activity (i.e., T = 4 weeks). With regard to the relationship of M versus D, Varotsos reported the following empirical relationship:\
log (ED) = a M + b	(2)where E is the maximum amplitude of SES, and a and b are the constants determined empirically from the observational data. Equation (2) means that the SES intensity decreases with D as 1/D.\
Compared to the lead time (T) of unusual animal behavior, the precursory time T of SES activity seems to be considerably larger as can be seen in Figure 3.\
4.1.2. ULF/ELF Electromagnetic Emissions\
This frequency range, especially ULF (f \uc0\u8804  1 Hz) has been extensively studied in different countries ever since three pioneering papers appeared for the Spitak [24], Loma Prieta [25] and Guam [26] EQs respectively. Hattori (2004) [27], Hayakawa and Hattori (2004) [28] and Molchanov and Hayakawa (2008) [14] summarized nearly all published data on seismogenic ULF emissions, plotted in Figure 4 in the form of D\'96M relations. The straight line, which marks the detection threshold of seismogenic ULF emissions (0.025 D = M \'96 4.5), is a linear regression line. According to these data, the maximum detection distance D is ~100 km for M = 7 and about 70\'9680 km for M = 6. The curve represents the empirical formula for abnormal animal behavior by Rikitake (1998) [4]. The straight line and the curve agree very closely for M values up to 7, but less so for the two events with M \u8805  7. This may simply be due to the fact that we used a linear regression line or to the fact that the number of events for M \u8805  7 is so small. When more events with M \u8805  7 become available, we will have to reexamine whether or not a present linear regression is acceptable.\
Animals 03 00019 g004 550Figure 4. Summary of seismogenic ultra-low-frequency (ULF) radio emissions as M-D plot. Open circles indicate events with ULF anomaly, solid circles event without ULF anomaly. Straight line: empirical threshold (0.025 D = M \uc0\u8722  4.5) by linear regression. Curve: Rikitake\'92s formula for unusual animal behavior.\
Next we present the summary result of precursory time (T) of seismogenic ULF emissions based on the previous events as depicted in Figure 4 [29]. They show a typical temporal evolution.\
(i)\
There seems to be no recognizable relationship between T and M.\
(ii)\
ULF emissions show first an intensity enhancement 1\'962 weeks before an EQ, lasting for about one week (at least a few days). Then there is evidence for quiescence a few days before an EQ. A pronounced increase occurs a few days before the EQ, followed by an additional abrupt increase a few hours before the EQ.\
A typical example (f = 0.01 Hz) of such a temporal evolution of seismogenic ULF emissions can be found for the Loma Prieta EQ [25]. The intensity of the first peak is 20 nT/sqrt(Hz), and the imminent peak amounted up to 60 nT/sqrt(Hz).\
Let us compare these results with the corresponding animal behavior in the previous section. The precursory time, T does not seem to be dependent on the EQ M, and the above summary on the temporal evolution seems to be very consistent with that of unusual animal behavior with the first peak at about 7\'9610 days before an EQ and the imminent peak just before the EQ. There is a conspicuous quiescence between the two peaks in the case of seismogenic ULF emissions, which looks to be in agreement with Figure 3 for the animal behavior. Of course, we are not sure whether a minimum in the distribution of T in Figure 3 indicates a real quiescence in the temporal evolution of animal behavior for a particular event or if it is merely a statistical combination of two separate peaks. Figure 4 in the form of D versus M for seismogenic ULF emissions is found to be very similar to the empirical formula by Rikitake (1998) [4] for animal behavior alone, especially in the M range below M = 7. Unfortunately ULF emission reports for large to very large EQs (M = 7\'968) are extremely rare, so it is not possible to make a relevant comparison of the two.\
Next we discuss the summary of ELF seismogenic emissions in the frequency range of less than 10 Hz. There have been very few reports on the radio emissions in this frequency range [29]. According to [14] and [29], based on a few years observation in Kamchatka, it is found that the radio emission in the frequency range from a few to a few tens of Hz appears to occur a few days before an EQ. Though no M\'96D relationship data are available, the detection distance D was found to be less than 300 km.\
4.1.3. ELF/VLF/LF radio noises\
A significant number of papers have been published on radio emissions in these frequency ranges [30]. Once the radio emissions reach the atmosphere, they can propagate globally, with small attenuation, in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide (e.g., [31]). There have been very few reports on statistical studies on the characteristics of those seismogenic ELF/VLF radio emissions. Therefore, these frequency ranges are not quite suitable in the present paper with respect to a comparison with local unusual animal behavior.\

(2006) [32] (with permission of the publisher) in which we define that strong emissions have a weight of unity and weak emissions have the weight of 0.5 (T in day).\
Animals 03 00019 g006 550Figure 6. ELF radio noise plotted as M-D relation. Adapted from Hata et al. (2006) [32] with permission of the publisher.\
However, there is one report on statistically relevant seismogenic ELF radio emissions (at 223 and 17 Hz) [32] drawing on observations over ten years. The precursory time (T) of these observations indicates that there is a peak in the occurrence 7\'9610 days before an EQ and an additional imminent peak just before the EQ (one day prior to the EQ), as shown in Figure 5. Figure 6 illustrates a statistical result on the M\'96D relationship, in which crosses indicate EQs with no ELF precursors, while the other symbols refer to EQs with ELF precursors. This figure shows that there is a general tendency that the detection distance (D) is larger for larger M values. The detection distance tends to be much larger for these frequencies than for the ULF emissions in Figure 4, due to the better propagation properties peculiar to this higher ELF range.\
Additional studies on seismogenic VLF/LF radio emissions have been done [33,34]. However, the plots of M versus D and occurrence distribution of T are not available for comparison.\
4.1.4. HF/VHF Radio Emissions\
In this frequency range, we can expect the radio emissions to be spatially localized. Enomoto et al. (1999) [35] presented a statistical study on seismo-HF/VHF radio emissions on the basis of observations at Tsukuba, Japan over the course of a few years. The following characteristics were obtained: (1) HF/VHF radio emissions appeared within 3\'964 days before an EQ and an abrupt increase occurred within one day before the EQ; (2) the detection distance was found to be several tens of km from the observatory, so that the HF/VHF radio emissions seem to be indeed highly localized; (3) no M-D information is available.\
4.2. Seismo-Atmospheric and Seismo\'96Ionospheric Effects\
Two reviews have been published, one on seismo-atmospheric effect [30] and the other on seismo-ionospheric perturbations [36]. The most efficient tool to study seismo-atmospheric perturbations is the use of the over-the-horizon VHF transmitter signals. It was found that abnormal reception of over-the-horizon VHF signals takes place about one week before an EQ. However, the mechanisms are uncertain as to how such atmospheric anomalies may be generated, even though there are a few possible mechanisms including ground surface temperature anomalies or positive hole effects [37]. In this sense, it is rather difficult to connect this phenomenon with unusual animal behavior.\
Nearly the same situation holds for seismo-ionospheric perturbations. Hayakawa (2009) [36] has concluded that the lower ionospheric perturbation might be observed about one week before an EQ. While, Liu (2009) [38] indicated that the upper ionospheric (F region) perturbations take place a few days before the EQ. Again, the type of mechanisms involved in the generation of seismo-ionospheric perturbation is poorly understood at the moment, though a few hypotheses have been proposed [36] such as: (1) radon emanation and the associated electric field change [39]; (2) positive hole effects and the corresponding electric field generation [37]; and (3) atmospheric oscillation effect [36]. In either case of (1) or (2), the generation of electric field (DC) is essentially of importance, so that it may be related with the abnormal animal behavior. The third possibility relates to the precursory ground movement, which seems to be ruled out as in Section 2 in the sense of abnormal animal behavior.\
5. Discussions\
Based on the suggestion of Rikitake (1998) [4], it appears that electromagnetic effects may be the most plausible candidate for causing abnormal animal behavior. In this paper, we first presented the statistical relations found by Rikitake between unusual behaviors of animals (dogs, cats, etc.) in terms of the three relationships of (i) M versus D, (ii) T versus M, and (iii) T occurrence histograms. Then we presented the statistical properties of seismogenic radio emissions in different frequency ranges while paying attention to the relationships (i)\'96(iii). Though the number of events for electromagnetic emissions is not large enough to have high statistical significance, it seems plausible as the result of comparisons, that the electromagnetic emissions in the ULF and lower ELF range are found to exhibit very similar characteristics in terms of the three relationships. Those emissions suggest a distinct temporal evolution: a first peak around one week before an EQ, followed by a second peak just before the EQ. This temporal change appears to be consistent with (or similar to) that of unusual animal behavior; the temporal evolution of unusual animal behavior also yields two peaks, a broad one about a week before an EQ and another just before the EQ.\
In the field of experimental biology, a laboratory experiment has recently been attempted by Nishimura et al. (2010) [11], which appears to be worthwhile so as to understand our hypothesis presented in this paper. They have suggested that lizards are likely to perceive the low frequency electromagnetic signals. However, further expounded experiments are essential to have a better understanding of animal sensory perception because this kind of laboratory experiment is very time-consuming and obtaining any statistically reliable results is generally difficult.\
It is further worthwhile to also mention studies of biological effects of radio signals by scientists in other disciplines. In the engineering EMC (Electromagnetic Compatibility) area, great attention has been paid to the possible biological effects of electromagnetic radiation in different frequency ranges (from ELF (power line frequencies) to VHF or even higher (mobile phone frequencies)) [40]. Since Werthemier and Leeper (1979) [41] noted a higher incidence of cancer among children living in homes where ELF exposure was presumed to be higher than usual, there has been a very large number of studies in different countries on the biological effect of ELF power lines [42]. Even after such extensive investigations, a consensus seems not to have been reached yet regarding the effect of power lines on biology effects (human, animals, etc.). However, when looking at the complete list of papers in the summary report by [40] on: (1) the exposure of ELF magnetic field on animals; and (2) the relationship between ELF magnetic field exposure and cancers, it appears that a considerable number of papers suggest some influence on smaller animals (like mice or rats), while the relationship between ELF exposure and human cancer remains quite uncertain. The serious problem in the EMC area is the statistical reliability or significance of the data because the number of samples is generally not sufficient. This is nearly the same situation as in the study of macroscopic anomalies of EQs.\
Next we discuss the biological effect of natural radio emissions. Cases of changes in the natural electromagnetic fields can be found in the scientific literature linking to observable effects on higher life forms which can also be found in the scientific literature. Such natural processes include solar, geomagnetic, cosmic ray, lightning activity, etc., and recently Cherry (2003) [43] suggested the importance of Schumann resonances in biology. Schumann resonances are a global resonance phenomenon excited primarily by background lightning discharges in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide [31]. The Schumann resonances are very weak, but very stationary with distinct frequencies at 8, 14, 20 Hz, etc. The high stationarity of Schumann resonances stands in sharp contrast to previously mentioned natural phenomena which are very transient. We have studied the biological effect of this Schumann resonance on the basis of our own ELF observation in Moshiri, Hokkaido and the simultaneous observation of human blood pressure, heart rate and depression, etc. [44]. These data were obtained between April and July 2001. It was found that the blood pressure in humans shows statistically significant mean differences between normal and enhanced Schumann resonance days. That is, the mean blood pressure rate is significantly lower for enhanced Schumann resonance days than for normal Schumann resonance days. The ELF magnetic field of Schumann resonances is extremely weak (<1 pT/sqrt(Hz)), so that its stationarity (or persistence) appears to be of primary importance.\
Finally, we suggest that any ULF/ELF seismogenic radio emissions may be a dominant source of unusual animal behavior before an EQ. The intensity of seismogenic ULF/ELF emissions is on the order of 1\'9650 nT (1 nT corresponds to 0.3 V/m in the atmosphere). These values have been used in the EMC area, to derive, for the purpose of risk management, a maximum permissible exposure, i.e. the field intensity (either electric or magnetic) multiplied by the exposure time is thought to be the primary factor in studies of abnormal animal behavior. In other words, even though the field intensity may not be very large (such as seismogenic noises (Schumann resonance as well)), the persistence or prolongation of the radiation may play an essential role in animal behavior. For example, seismogenic precursory ULF emissions are known to persist, at least, for a few days or even up to about one week. Of course, there remain so many questions; e.g., is the electric or magnetic field influential on the animals?\
6. Conclusion\
Based on the intense comparison of characteristics of abnormal animal behavior and seismogenic electromagnetic radiation in a wide frequency range, we come to the conclusion that lower frequency (such as ULF and ELF) electromagnetic emissions are a plausible candidate to explain abnormal animal behavior before an EQ. In order to verify this hypothesis, the following steps are essential: (i) further anecdotal and retrospective studies of abnormal animal behavior; (ii) a coordinated measurement of animal behavior with seismic and chemical sensors in combination with electromagnetic sensors in a seismically active region (as suggested in [5]).}{\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252\cocoartf2577

\f0\fs24 \cf0 Humans\'97like other animals\'97may sense Earth\'92s magnetic field\
\
A study published today offers some of the best evidence yet that humans, like many other creatures, can sense Earth\'92s magnetic field. But it doesn\'92t settle other questions that have swirled around this contentious idea for decades: If we do have a subconscious magnetic sense, does it affect our behavior? And does it arise from an iron mineral found in our brains, as the authors believe?\
\
\'93I think this paper will make quite a splash,\'94 says Peter Hore, a physical chemist at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom. But, he adds, \'93Independent replication is crucial.\'94\
\
A variety of species\'97bacteria, snails, frogs, lobsters\'97seem to detect Earth\'92s magnetic field, and some animals, such as migratory birds, rely on it for navigation. But testing for the sense in humans has been tricky. Experiments in the 1970s that asked blindfolded participants to point in a cardinal direction after being spun around or led far from home yielded inconsistent results.\
\
Biophysicist Joe Kirschvink at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena is a veteran of the search. Using electroencephalography (EEG), his team recorded brain activity from electrodes on the scalp to search for some response to changes in a highly controlled magnetic field equal in strength to Earth\'92s.\
\
In the experiment, each of the 34 participants sat quietly in a dark aluminum box that shielded them from electromagnetic noise such as radio waves. By changing the flow of electric current through coils lining the box, the researchers created a magnetic field that sloped steeply downward, like Earth\'92s own field at the midlatitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. Then they rotated the field, as would happen if a person turned their head.\
\
In an EEG study with a different design, published in 2002, other researchers failed to find any brain response to a changing field. Kirschvink says data analysis techniques used at the time were not powerful enough to detect an effect. The new study, published in eNeuro, found that the rotating field sometimes elicited a marked drop in waves of the \uc0\u945  frequency, which are typical of a brain that is awake but at rest. Many EEG studies use \u945  to track responses to visual information, says Mary MacLean, a neuroscientist at the University of California (UC), Santa Barbara, who was not involved in the work. A change in \u945 , she says, \'93is generally a good indicator of the degree to which people are engaging in sensory processing.\'94\
\
The effect showed up in less than a third of participants, which could indicate that genetic factors or past experiences influence a person\'92s sensitivity to a magnetic field, says cognitive neuroscientist Shinsuke Shimojo, another member of the Caltech team. Mysteriously, the change registered only when the field was rotated counterclockwise.\
\
\'93What they show is very exciting and seems robust,\'94 says Stuart Gilder, a geophysicist at Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich, Germany. But the results call for follow-up tests, such as measuring how different field strengths and rotation speeds affect brain activity, he adds.\
\
\'93I\'92m not surprised there\'92s an effect,\'94 says Margaret Ahmad, a biologist at Sorbonne University in Paris, who notes that magnetic fields are known to affect human and other mammalian cells in a dish. \'93There\'92s something in a cell that is different in the presence of a magnetic field,\'94 she says. \'93We see this effect in human embryonic kidney cells; you\'92re not going to convince me that an effect in brain cells is of any greater or lesser significance.\'94\
\
The Caltech team is still far from explaining how magnetoreception is possible, scientists say. \'93I\'92m convinced that something in the brain is responding to a magnetic field in a particular way,\'94 Maclean says. \'93I just have no idea \'85 what mechanism that really represents.\'94\
\
The mechanism of magnetoreception is only settled for certain bacteria, which harbor magnetite crystals that align with Earth\'92s magnetic field. Bird beaks and fish snouts also contain magnetite, as does the human brain. Gilder and his colleagues recently found that it is most concentrated in lower, evolutionarily ancient regions\'97the brain stem and cerebellum. But no one has identified the proposed sensory cells that contain magnetite.\
\
Other groups suggest a protein in the retina called cryptochrome, which senses incoming light, also responds to magnetic fields. But Kirschvink\'92s team contends its new results tip the scales in favor of magnetite. When they reversed their magnetic field to point upward, its rotations no longer elicited a change in brain activity. Magnetite, like a compass needle, responds to a field\'92s direction, whereas cryptochrome would respond identically to fields with opposite polarity.\
\
\'93If the results are real, I think that rules out cryptochrome as the source of these effects in humans,\'94 Hore says, though it might play a role in other animals.\
\
But is a change in brain waves alone evidence of a \'93sense\'94? Some aren\'92t convinced. \'93If I were to \'85 stick my head in a microwave and switch it on, I would see effects on my brain waves,\'94 says Thorsten Ritz, a biophysicist at UC Irvine. \'93That doesn\'92t mean we have a microwave sense.\'94\
\
More convincing would be evidence that the brain actually processes magnetic information in a way that influences behavior, Ritz says. He is intrigued by a study from a South Korean research team, published last month in PLOS ONE, which found that, in the absence of visual or auditory cues, men who had fasted for about 20 hours could sometimes orient themselves in a direction they previously associated with food.\
\
Kirschvink\'92s team has experiments in progress that aim to unearth subtle consequences of a magnetic sense\'97for example, manipulating the magnetic field to bias a person\'92s best guess at a cardinal direction. \'93That would really supersolidly establish that humans have a full-fledged magnetosensory system,\'94 says Caltech neuroscience graduate student Connie Wang, who is first author on the new paper. The team also wants to test whether careful training could bring magnetic sensations into consciousness.\
\
If humans really use a magnetite-based sensor, there are other concerns to explore, Kirschvink says, such as whether the magnets in aviation headsets could impair pilots\'92 sense of direction, and whether the strong magnetic field generated by MRI machines could somehow alter our magnetite.\
\
Three years ago, Kirschvink gave a preview of these results at a meeting of the United Kingdom\'92s Royal Institute of Navigation, which meets every 3 years in Egham. On 12 April, at the society\'92s next meeting, he\'92ll take the stage to defend his ideas to an audience of skeptics, with data in hand. \'93We\'92re going to have a fun session,\'94 he says.}{\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252\cocoartf2577

\f0\fs24 \cf0 Ultraviolet (UV) light perception by birds: a review\
\
J. Rajchard\
Faculty of Agriculture, University of South Bohemia, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic\
ABSTRACT: The ability to perceive the near ultraviolet part of the light spectrum (the wavelength 320\'96400 nm)\
has been detected in many bird species. This ability is an important bird sense. The ecological importance of UV\
perception has been studied mainly in the context of intra- and inter-sexual signalling, common species communication and also in foraging. Some birds of prey use UV reflectance in their feeding strategy: e.g., the kestrel (Falco\
tinnunculus), but also other birds of prey are able to recognize the presence of voles by perceiving the UV reflectance\
of their scent urine marks. The ability to detect the presence of prey is a common feature of birds with analogous\
feeding spectra in taxonomically distinct species. UV perception and its use in foraging have also been proved in\
predominantly herbivorous bird species. This ability is possessed both by bird species living in northern habitats and\
others living in tropical forests. The signalling and communication role of the UV perception is very important. The\
plumage of many bird species shows specific colour features \'96 e.g., sexually different regions in plumage coloration\
unnoticed by the human eye. Also other body parts can have similar features \'96 e.g., supra-orbital combs in the red\
grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus). All these characteristics are important primarily in the mate-choice decision. Birds\
apparently also use their ability of UV perception for recognition of their own eggs. Some bird species are able to\
modify plumage UV reflectance by uropygial secretions. The knowledge of all specific aspects of bird physiology can\
significantly help both breeders of various bird species and facilitate effective veterinary care.\
Keywords: UV; reflectance; food detection; coloring; plumage; communication\
1. Introduction\
Sight is the dominant sense of most birds. Besides\
other visual particularities, the important ability to\
perceive UV radiation has been demonstrated in\
many bird species. The data available on this part\
of bird physiology is being increasing all the time.\
The basic information has already appeared in encyclopaedic publications (e.g., Veselovsky, 2001).\
The ability to perceive the near ultraviolet part of\
light spectrum (the wavelength 320\'96400 nm) has\
been indicated in a range of animal species: at least\
35 diurnal bird species (obviously mainly diurnal\
raptors, frugivorous, nectarivorous and insectivorous species), four rodent species, 11 reptilian species and two amphibian species (Honkavaara et al.,\
2002). Most of this data has been gleaned recently.\
Burkhardt (1996) notes that most birds have three\
cone types with absorption maxima in the ranges\
450\'96480 nm, 510\'96540 nm, and 565\'96620 nm and\
suggests tetrachromatic colour vision. He presents\
some examples of the possible significance of UV\
perception by birds: reflection of UV from feathers\
as well as from fruits with waxy layers.\
It is now known that avian ocular media do\
not absorb UV light before it reaches the retina;\
thus UV sensitivity in birds is possible. Birds have\
4\'965 types of single cone photoreceptors, including one type sensitive to UV light (for comparison\
humans have only three types of cone photorecepContents\

tors). Many birds (obviously the majority of species,\
e.g., many non-passerines) have a violet-sensitive\
single cone that is obviously sensitive to UV wavelengths. Other species (e.g., some passerines) have\
a single cone that has maximum sensitivity to UV\
light. The input of the UV cone is involved in bird\
chromatic colour vision system: this role of UV\
light in the detection of chromaticity differences\
(colour vision) was studied on the European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) as an example of Passerines,\
and the Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) as an example of non-passerine (Order Galliformes in this\
case). Birds of both species distinguished between a\
long wave control of orange versus red stimuli and\
UV versus \'93non-UV\'94 in the same way. They were\
able to discriminate spectral stimuli in accordance\
with the amount of the reflected light in the UV\
part of the spectrum composed of longer wavelengths (Veselovsky, 2001; Smith et al., 2002).\
The objective of the study was also a comparison of the bird light spectrum perception with that\
of human. However, the differences between bird\
(specifically pigeon) and human vision including UV\
wavelengths perception has already been discussed\
by Cuthill and Bennett (1993); they have noted the\
lack of information concerning wild birds. Recently,\
the spectral sensitivity of domestic ducks (Anas\
platyrhynchos domesticus) and turkeys (Meleagris\
gallopavo gallopavo) was tested over a range of\
specified wavelengths, including UVA, between\
326\'96694 nm in comparison with human spectral\
sensitivity (Barber et al., 2006). The results showed\
that ducks and turkeys had similar spectral sensitivities and could perceive UVA radiation. Turkeys were\
more sensitive to UVA than ducks. The peak sensitivity was in the wavelengths between 544\'96577 nm,\
with reduced sensitivity at 508\'96600 nm. Both bird\
species had a very different and broader range of\
spectral sensitivity than humans.\
Some genetic aspects of the visual abilities of\
birds have also been studied recently. Odeen et al.\
(2009) reported on in vitro mutation studies, which\
allow the prediction of the maximum absorbance\
wavelengths (\uc0\u955 max) of avian UV/violet sensitive\
visual pigments (SWS1) from the identity of a few\
key amino acid residues in the opsin gene. Simply\
from the \uc0\u955 max, the absorbance spectrum of a cone\'92s\
visual pigment and its pigmented oil droplet can\
be determined. Thus in \uc0\u955 max, the molecular data\
from genomic DNA predict the gross differences\
between the violet- and ultraviolet-sensitive subtypes of SWS1 opsin. It is possible to detect the entire spectral sensitivity of bird species using genetic\
samples from live birds or museum specimens. The\
authors obtained partial sequences covering three\
of the known spectral tuning sites in the SWS1\
opsin and predicted \uc0\u955 max, for all bird species, for\
which the spectral absorbance has been measured\
by microspectrophotometry. They also proved that\
one bird species under examination \'96 the bobolink\
Dolichonyx oryzivorus (Passeriformes, Icteridae)\
\'96 has apparently more than one SWS1 visual pigment in its retina.\
The ecological importance of UV vision has\
mainly been studied in the context of intra- and\
inter-sexual signalling, species signalling and also\
in foraging (Veselovsky, 2001; Honkavaara et al.,\
2002); UV vision is also important in navigation,\
wide intraspecies communication and the control\
of circadian rhythms, and all this in different taxons, including both vertebrates and invertebrates\
(Tovee, 1995).\
An understanding of all specific aspects of bird\
physiology can significantly help both breeders of\
various bird species (e.g., in breeding of endangered\
bird species, poultry) and improve veterinary care.\
2. Prey detection in birds of prey\
Quite a lot is known about the ability of birds of\
prey to perceive UV radiation. Some species are\
known to use UV reflectance in their food strategy.\
Foraging birds may use either UV cues (reflectance or absorbance) of food items or UV cues of\
the environment. This ability was experimentally\
studied in the common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus).\
Kestrels are able to recognize vole trails (mainly\
Microtus arvalis, Microtus agrestis and other usual prey) by perceiving the UV reflectance of scent\
marks. These marks from vole urine appear in UV\
radiation as yellow. The question of whether the\
use of scent marks in the UV range is an innate\
feature or if it is acquired by experience was tested\
by Zampiga et al. (2006) in experiments on adult\
and juvenile individuals. The authors deduced that\
the association between vole scent UV reflectance\
and the presence of voles is an innate component,\
but that the ability to detect UV cues is a learned\
component. The ability to use UV reflectance in\
food strategy has been demonstrated not only in\
birds of prey (birds of order Falconiformes), but\
also in carnivorous birds of other orders, e.g., order\
Passeriformes. The results of experiments on the \
Veterinarni Medicina, 54, 2009 (8): 351\'96359 Review Article\
353\
great grey shrike (Lanius excubitor) indicate that\
this passerine probably uses UV cues to determine\
the presence of voles (Probst et al., 2002). However,\
the ability to detect prey is common for birds with\
analogous feeding spectra in taxonomically distinct\
species. In many areas, there are fluctuations in small\
rodent (mainly voles) populations between years\
(usually over a four-year period). Viitala et al. (1995)\
examined the reaction of common kestrels (Falco\
tinnunculus) to small rodent population density in\
northern Europe. The results of laboratory and field\
experiments on the common kestrel and the vole\
Microtus agrestis explain how raptors detect patches\
of high vole density without prior knowledge of rodent quantity as a food resource. Kestrels flying over\
landscape follow the vole marks \'96 urine and faeces\
\'96 that are visible in the UV light in order to assess the\
numbers of prey. The ability to follow these marks of\
the presence of voles enables the raptors to screen\
large areas in a relatively short time.\
The same ability was demonstrated for the\
rough-legged buzzard (Buteo lagopus) (Koivula and\
Viitala, 1999). During field experiments in northern\
Finland, these buzzards were observed more often\
in localities with vole marks. It is evident that they\
use these marks in choosing the prey hunting and\
breeding area.\
3. Food detection by other birds\
UV perception and its importance in foraging have\
also been studied in predominantly herbivorous\
bird species. A possible UV sensitivity of the black\
grouse (Tetrao tetrix \'96 Order Galliformes, Family\
Tetraonidae) is indicated by the results of laboratory\
experiments on these birds. Black grouses preferred\
UV-reflecting bilberries (Vaccinium myrtillus) to\
two colour morphs of bilberry (UV-reflecting and\
non-UV-reflecting); no preferences were observed\
in the absence of the UV light (Siitari and Viitala,\
2002). The above observation was made in northern\
habitats (e.g., tundra and taiga). It is consistent that\
similar strategies occur in habitats with maximally\
wide biodiversity \'96 tropical rainforests.\
The significant role of UV reflectance in relations\
between plants and frugivores was demonstrated by\
Altshuler (2001), who tested the reflectance spectra\
of fruits from 57 tropical plant species on Barro\
Colorado Island in Panama. UV-reflecting fruits\
were present in both open and closed light habitats\
and were strongly associated with the occurrence of\
birds and rodents, both of which perceive UV radiation. A key fact is that only mature fruits reflected\
the UV \'96 it is a visual signal for frugivore birds or\
other frugivores. The understorey shrub Psychotria\
emetica (Family Rubiaceae) was chosen as an example for an experimental study on the removal of\
fruit. During a 3-month period, the ambient light\
was manipulated by placing a UV-absorbing filter over fruiting plants, with control treatments\
of plants under clear filters (UV-transmitting) and\
plants without filters. Fewer fruits were removed\
from shrubs under the UV-absorbing filter, showing\
that UV reflectance can be an important attractant\
for the consumption of some fruit (and dispersal of\
its seed). This study establishes a relationship between the perceptual abilities of animals (including\
frugivorous birds as an example of animals finding\
their food by visual sense) and the colour of the\
fruits they consume.\
Experiments have also been carried out on free-flying crows (Corvus ossifragus) under the seminatural\
conditions in an aviary. The important result of these\
experiments was that the discrimination of coloured\
objects (e.g., fruits) by birds can be influenced by the\
background. Thus, experiments on colour perception\
can be improved by incorporating background-specific effects (Schaefer et al., 2006). The experimental\
crows detected red fruits at a larger distance than\
black fruits. Artificial red fruits had higher chromatic and lower achromatic contrasts against foliage\
than artificial black fruits, so the crows apparently\
prioritized chromatic contrast. The colour change\
in the fruit colour from red to black during ripening\
thus does not increase attractiveness to the crows.\
The crows were also tested against two types of\
black berries (Vaccinum myrtillus): UV-reflecting\
berries and black blueberries, against backgrounds\
of foliage and against backgrounds of sand. In the\
first case \'96 against foliage \'96 the crows detected the\
UV-reflecting berries at a larger distance, because\
these fruits had higher chromatic and achromatic\
contrasts. Against the backgrounds of sand, the UVreflecting berries had low achromatic contrasts and\
black berries had low chromatic contrasts. As the\
crows detected both black berry types equally, they\
apparently used chromatic contrasts to detect the\
UV-reflecting berries, and the achromatic contrasts\
to detect the black berries.\
Other studies have been carried out in the frequent\
bird model, the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata\
\'96 Order Passeriformes, Family Estrildidae). The\
removal of UV wavelengths significantly changed \
Review Article Veterinarni Medicina, 54, 2009 (8): 351\'96359\
354\
the strength and frequency dependence of the seed\
preferences compared to the full-spectrum illumination. It did not affect the strength of frequency\
dependence compared to the removal of the short\
wavelengths (approximately 400\'96500 nm), medium\
wavelengths (approximately 500\'96600 nm) or long\
wavelengths (approximately 600\'96700 nm; Church\
et al., 2001). The authors discuss the possibility of\
ecological impact: the affect on the dynamics of\
the plant population depending upon the spectral\
quality of ambient light (it differs considerably depending on the climate, time of the day and local\
habitat geometry), but they warn of overestimating\
the importance of UV light compared to the human-visible spectrum.\
Insectivorous birds also use chromatic cues in\
the search for prey. The principal for the finding of\
food is the differentiation of food in its background.\
Blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) were presented with\
two prey types that were achromatically identical but different in their chromatic properties in\
the UV/blue range on two achromatically identical backgrounds. The backgrounds had either the\
same chromatic properties as the prey (matching\
combination) or differed in their chromatic properties (mismatching combination). The tits used\
the chromatic cues successfully in their search in\
the mismatching background. The duration of prey\
search on the matching background was significantly longer, but the search for more chromatic\
prey on the same background was easier. The birds\
evidently used the combination of achromatic and\
chromatic cues for the successful search for prey\
(Stobbe et al., 2009).\
4. Signal and communication significance\
The presence of UV reflecting plumage assumes\
the perception of UV wavelengths and suggests\
ecological significance (in inter- or intra-specific\
relations). Muellen and Pohland (2008) describe\
the results of the study on the existence of plumage\
regions with high proportions of the UV-reflecting feathers in nine hundred and sixty-eight bird\
species, covering all orders. Across nine orders:\
Struthioniformes, Tinamiformes, Craciformes,\
Turniciformes, Galbuliformes, Upupiformes,\
Coliiformes, Apodiformes and Musophagiformes\
all species were tested. High proportions of UVreflecting plumage were found in some coloured\
plumage regions. The species of some orders used\
mostly the UV maxima between 380-399 nm, these\
probably have a violet sensitive (VS) cone; other orders with ultraviolet sensitive (UVS) cones had their\
UV maxima mostly between 300 and 379 nm.\
This suggests that it is not objective to classify\
the colouring of the bird plumage only according to\
human colour perception. Conspecific can perceive\
the plumage colouring differently, because most\
birds are visually sensitive to the wavelengths in\
the near-ultraviolet (300\'96400 nm). One example is\
the blue tit (Parus caeruleus = Cyanistes caeruleus),\
whose plumage shows considerable reflection of\
UV light. This species is sexually dichromatic for\
multiple regions of the plumage such as the crest,\
which shows the peak reflectance at wavelengths\
around 352 nm. This fact is important for the mate\
choice: the results of the experiments indicate\
that the blue tit females prefer the males with the\
brightest crests (Hunt et al., 1998). It is possible\
to markedly reduce the plumage brightness in the\
blue tit by experimentally accelerating the moult\
speed on the UV/blue crown feathers (for comparison the structural white on the cheek feather\
was not affected). UV/Blue colours are considered\
as a marker of an individual\'92s performance during\
the previous breeding season. The relationship between the fast moulting and the colour expression\
present a selective advantage for early-breeding\
birds (Griggio et al., 2009).\
In the example of the great tit (Parus major\
\'96 Order Passeriformes, Family Paridae), the differences in the spectral reflectance of the yellow\
breast feathers in yearlings (though not older birds)\
between some populations have been identified.\
These differences in coloration among young birds\
of different origins correspond to genetic differences that were determined earlier. Systematic\
differences in colour signals probably exist across\
populations, among individuals of different origins\
(Postma and Gienapp, 2009).\
Also starlings (Sturnus vulgaris \'96 Passeriformes,\
Sturnidae) have sexually different body regions in\
plumage coloration unnoticed by the human eye.\
Cuthill et al. (1999) used multivariate analyses on\
principal components of reflectance spectra (300\
to 720 nm) of plumage samples from different body\
regions of male and female starlings. Sex differences occurred in some body regions (though not\
in all), and were more pronounced at some wavelengths (both ultraviolet and human visible).\
This phenomenon occurs across the taxonomical groups; Mahler and Kempenaers (2002) found \
Veterinarni Medicina, 54, 2009 (8): 351\'96359 Review Article\
355\
differences in the UV reflectance of the plumage\
between males and females of the bird of Order\
Columbiformes, Family Columbidae \'96 picui dove\
(Columbina picui). The male plumage was brighter than the one of females. Several body regions\
showed a significant sex difference in spectral\
shape, although this bird species was considered\
sexually monochromatic.\
An interesting finding was that visible sexual dichromatism in the plumage coloration (blue males\
and green females) in many species of tanagers\
(Passeriformes, Thraupidae) is that reflectance\
spectrophotometry is uniform, without sexual differences. This phenomenon was investigated in the\
swallow tanager (Tersina viridis) and the blue dacnis (Dacnis cayana) (Barreira et al., 2008). However,\
males showed a secondary peak of reflectance in\
the UV part of the spectrum, which females do not\
have. This male plumage bimodal reflectance causes the visual aspect, but it is different from the common unimodal pattern of the blue plumage. In this\
domain, the role of the UV light perception in the\
communication during the avian mate choice \'96 as\
one of several possibilities \'96 was studied. Bennett\
et al. (1996) published the basic finding of the use\
of the UV light in the mate-choice decision in the\
zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata).\
In the experiments performed by Hunt et al.\
(2001), the female zebra finches remarkably preferred the UV-reflecting males to the males whose\
UV reflection was removed. In these experiments,\
colored filters which removed single blocks of the\
avian visible spectrum were used. The block filters were chosen in order to correspond with the\
spectral sensitivities of the single cone classes of\
the studied birds. Some experimental males had no\
UV plumage reflection; others had no short-wave\
(SW), no medium-wave (MW) or no long-wave\
(LW). The females preferred the male individuals\
with UV and SW. The results show that the role of\
the UV waveband is important in the zebra finch\
mate choice in conjunction with other parts of the\
avian visible spectrum. The reflection from different plumage areas varies. Little or no UV reflection\
exists in some plumage areas, but despite this fact\
the observed effect is very strong. However, the\
authors conclude that the importance of UV light\
compared to the other regions of the bird-visible\
spectrum is not clear.\
A very interesting finding is that the birds appearing\
in the human visible light as \'93black and white\'94 \'96 penguins (two species: gentoo penguin \'96 Pygoscelis\
papua and king penguin \'96 Aptenodytes patagonicus; Order Sphenisciformes, Family Spheniscidae)\
have some UV reflecting marks (Meyer-Rochow\
and Shimoyama, 2008). Photographs of these bird\
species through a filter that transmits only UV radiation and blocks all visible light reveal that king\
penguins with white (but not yellow or orange) auricular patches reflect UV from these areas. Also\
the beaks of juvenile (not adult) gentoo penguins\
are UV-reflecting. The authors consider this to be\
an \'93associative phenomenon\'94 without behavioural\
significance. The intensive reflectance of the beak\
horn of the king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus)\
has already been described by Dresp and Langley\
(2006) and it is believed to have significance relating to mate choice. Both the structure of crystallike photonic elements capable of reflecting in the\
near-UV and the detailed fine structure of the king\
penguin beak horn have also been described. The\
authors present the important finding that the lattice\
dimensions of the photonic crystals and morphological composition properties permit predictions\
of the wavelength of reflected light. The way of the\
UV signal is optimized by the fine structure of the\
beak tissue. There is apparently one-dimensional\
structural periodicity within this tissue.\
An example of a bird that has plumage sexual dichromatism \'96 invisible for humans \'96 is the yellowbreasted chat (Icteria virens \'96 Order Passeriformes,\
Family Parulidae; Mays et al., 2004). This species\
lives in Northern America, from the southern plains\
of Canada to central Mexico during the summer,\
and migrate mainly to Mexico and Central America,\
although some of them may spend the winter in\
coastal areas. Spectrophotometric analyses reveals\
that the plumage on this species\'92 neck and breast\
exhibits reflective curves with two peaks, one in\
the ultraviolet and the other at the yellow end of\
the spectrum. Male plumage of the breast patch\
reflected more UV light and yellow wavelengths\
than female plumage in the same part of the body.\
Male neck feathers appeared brighter than those\
of females only in the UV. The reason for this are\
the different concentrations of carotenoid all-trans\
lutein in male plumage compared to the female one.\
Naturally, unpigmented feathers reflected more UV\
light than yellow ones. This phenomenon probably\
has basic importance in intraspecific relations, primarily in the mate choice.\
The markedly positive relationship among colour\
patches, brightness of plumage, male age and the mass\
of the offspring was described for the Sialia mexicana\
Review Article Veterinarni Medicina, 54, 2009 (8): 351\'96359\
356\
(Passeriformes, Turdidae) by Budden and Dickinson\
(2009). The birds\'92 condition and sexual preferences\
relate to this relationship. Some traits (plumage patch\
on the back, size of the rufous breast patch) show\
dependence on condition and/or age, while spectral\
characters from the wings and rump were not associated with any of the measured reproductive parameters. The results underline the importance of\
experimental tests to understand the mate choice in\
this species (naturally also for other species).\
Males of congeneric species (from the same genus) \'96 Sialia currucoides \'96 have brilliant UV-blue\
plumage. Males of this monogamous species with\
brighter and more UV-blue plumage sired at least\
one extra pair of offspring, on average. Thus, these\
males were more successful at reproduction, fertilized the eggs of more females, sired more offspring both with their own mate and tended to\
sire offspring with extra-pair mates. The grade of\
the plumage colouration is evidently an important\
factor in sexual choice (Balenger et al., 2009).\
Some bird species are able to modify the plumage\
UV reflectance by uropygial secretions. Two main\
types of uropygial secretions which reduce the relative UV reflectance of the white background exist.\
One type occurs predominantly in passerines, the\
other one in non-passerines. Secretions reduce for\
example the brightness and the UV reflectance of the\
white feathers of the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos)\
and significantly affect the reflectance of the UV/blue\
crown feathers of the blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus).\
Uropygial secretions probably do not play the major\
role in modifying the UV reflectance of plumage, but\
they can be involved \'96 in some measure \'96 in the visual\
signalling system of birds (Delhey et al., 2008).\
A very interesting finding is that the relationship\
between androgen concentrations in avian eggs and\
male attractiveness may exist. In experiments on\
blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) it was shown that the\
attractiveness of the males of this species lies in the\
UV coloration of the crown feather and it is presumed that the females are able to perceive this feature. The sexually selected UV coloration of the male\
crown feathers was manipulated (reduced). Levels of\
testosterone (not androstenedione), in eggs five and\
seven were higher for females with attractive males\
compared to those with unattractive (UV-reduced)\
males. The difference was not found in the ninth egg,\
coinciding with the recovery of the UV coloration\
after manipulation (similarly androgen concentrations in the second egg did not correlate with still\
unaffected male crown plumage).\
These results suggest that females are capable\
of modifying testosterone content in response to\
changes in the sexual attractiveness of their mates\
(Kingma et al., 2009).\
The melanin layer in the feather barbules plays the\
principal role in light reflectance. This layer may in\
some barbules be thin enough to allow interaction\
with the underlying keratin. The resultant plumage\
colour is caused by layers in the structure of the\
matter with different refractive indexes (in feathers\
keratin, melanin and air usually). This question was\
studied by spectrometry, electron microscopy and\
thin-film optical modelling with the aim of describing the UV-reflecting iridescent colour of feather\
barbules. For the experiments, the feather of the male\
blue-black grassquits \'96 Volatinia jacarina (Order\
Passeriformes, Family Emberizidae) characterized\
by a keratin layer overlying a single melanin layer\
was used. The results indicate that both the keratin\
and the melanin layers are essential for production\
of the observed colour (Maia et al., 2009).\
Another body part, in which UV reflectance was\
demonstrated, is the supra-orbital combs of the\
red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus (Gallliformes,\
Tetraonidae). Also in this case this property acts as a\
signal in the mate choice, but by an unexpected mechanism. The combs reflect both the red (600\'96700 nm)\
and the UV (300\'96400 mn) part of the spectrum.\
Although the males have bigger and redder combs\
than females, female combs have greater UV brightness; similarly, both young males and females show\
brighter UV than old individuals (Mougeot et al.,\
2005). These authors tested also the potential influence of health in the example of parasitic invasion:\
the intensity of caecal threadworm Trichostrongylus\
tenuis (Nematoda) invasion was not significantly related to the comb size or brightness, but it was possible to predict the presence of fewer worms from\
the UV in the combs of both sexes. Thus, the UV\
reflectance of combs is one of the indications of the\
potential mate\'92s health and can play an important\
role in the mate choice of this bird species.\
The combs of these birds represent bright carotenoid-dependent orange-red sexual ornaments. The\
UV reflectance of combs decreases with increasing\
comb size and red colouring. The UV reflectance is\
a property of the dermis, underneath the epidermis.\
In the red pigmented epidermis, there are carotenoid\
pigments that reduce the reflectance of the dermis in\
the range 400\'96550 nm and in the UV, 300\'96400 nm.\
The experimental removal of the red epidermis of\
combs increased the UV reflectance. Patagium skin \
Veterinarni Medicina, 54, 2009 (8): 351\'96359 Review Article\
357\
under the grouse wings also reflects the UV, but\
in this body part the mediator of this property is\
epidermis: its removal from this bare part tends to\
reduce the UV reflectance (Mougeot et al., 2007).\
The UV perception has also its function in the parental care of birds. A markedly coloured mouth (and\
surroundings) in the nestlings of many bird species are\
known as visual signals for their parents. Hunt et al.\
(2003) proved that both mouths and their surrounding flanges show two striking peaks of reflectance in\
the UV light, coupled with the high long-wavelength\
reflectance. The above mentioned high UV reflectance is apparently an important cue for the parents\
bringing food to nestlings, as the contrast with the\
nest background is maximal in the UV radiation.\
Aviles and Soler (2009) compared the nestling\
colouration and the concurrently visual sensitivity\
in 22 altricial bird species and assessed some differences in performance of typical UV-tuned and\
violet-tuned bird eyes when looking at the nestling\
traits under the ordinary light regimes in their nests.\
The results indicate an evidently higher importance\
of the UV over the violet at detecting gape and body\
skin traits in either open- or hole-nest light conditions. Gape colouration corresponds to the visual\
system tuning of adult conspecific birds.\
Carotenoids reduce the reflectance of ultraviolet\
wavelengths of the rictal flanges. Thorogood et al.\
(2008) carried out field experiments on Notiomystis\
cincta (Passeriformes, Noctiomystidae), with supplements of carotenoids to the nestlings and their\
provisioning parents. The effect on nestling mouth\
colouration was measured with a spectrometer.\
Increased carotenoid availability in the diet enhanced the circulating blood plasma carotenoid\
concentrations, and this influenced mouth palate\
and rictal flange colouration. The high carotenoid\
availability also increased the saturation of the yellow wavelengths of the spectrum reflected by both\
the palate and the flanges. Thus, carotenoids apparently influence the appearance of nestling gapes\
both by increasing the pigmentation and as a filter\
of the UV-reflecting structures and they contribute in this way to the communication between the\
nestlings and their parents.\
UV reflectance marks occur not only in the plumage, bill and other parts of a bird\'92s body. Birds apparently use their ability of UV perception also for\
recognition of their eggs. The results of experiments with recognition of variously coloured eggs\
(blue model eggs as mimetic, others coloured as\
nonmimetic eggs) by the song thrush (Turdus philomelos \'96 Passeriformes, Turdidae) suggest that the\
decisive factors in the recognition of eggs are the\
UV and green parts of spectrum. These colours\
significantly influenced the egg rejection in this\
bird species (Honza et al., 2007). The significance of\
this property lies apparently in the recognition and\
rejection of the eggs of breeding parasitic birds.\
5. Practical impacts on breeding, including\
veterinary care\
A lot is evident from the above text. It is known\
that ultraviolet wavelengths are a component of\
normal avian colour perception. It is possible to\
expect other physiological influences of this environmental factor. Many artificial light conditions do\
not represent a full light spectrum. Maddocks et al.\
(2001) investigated the influence of the chronic longterm effects of the absence of UV light on domestic chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus) in connection\
with the welfare of these animals. The topic of the\
investigation was the hormonal stress response to\
the absence of UV light. Chicks kept in a UV lightdeficient environment had significantly higher basal\
plasma corticosterone concentrations. The control\
group \'96 chicks subjected to the full light spectrum\
had a significantly higher rate of corticosterone rise\
in stress situations compared to the chicks kept in\
UV light-deficient conditions, but there were some\
subsidiary influences (e.g., age).\
Analogous results were reached by Maddocks\
et al. (2002) in experiments on European starlings\
(Sturnus vulgaris). Juvenile starlings had significantly higher basal plasma corticosterone concentrations in the UV-deficient light environments than\
those kept under the full spectrum lighting. The\
birds under the UV-deficient conditions showed\
significant changes in their behaviour (escaping behaviour). When the interval between the transfer\
from the wild to the experimental conditions was\
short (two days) birds showed significantly higher\
basal and maximum plasma corticosterone concentrations than starlings which were transferred after\
7\'9614 days in captivity. In the second case, the capture stress had already subsided. Thus, the stress\
effects of UV light deficiency are apparently small\
relative to the overall impact of captivity; nevertheless, the former may become the more significant\
factor after the initial effects of capture subside.\
The authors note the significance of the full light\
spectrum for the welfare of captive birds.\

For the study of museum specimens, it is very\
important to know the durability of the plumage\
features. Ultraviolet colour may be more susceptible\
to degradation than colours visible by the human eye\
as suggested by a study which performed measurements on five species of passerines collected over the\
past 100 years with a reflectance spectrophotometer.\
Contrary to these results, the results of the tests on\
the specimens collected within the past 50 years suggest that the colours were relatively unimpaired and\
that UV is not affected by fading more severely than\
human-visible colours (Armenta et al., 2008).}{\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252\cocoartf2577

?? Abstract\
 In the last twenty years, hundreds of experiments have\
been carried out on animals to assess cancer-related risks\
of exposure to extremely-low-frequency (ELF) and\
radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields. Most of the\
work has been performed at frequencies related to the\
generation of electricity at 50/60Hz and mobile\
telephony at around 1 GHz.\
Results obtained on cancer-related models are described\
in this brief review in terms of the risk evaluation that is\
necessary for the establishment of exposure guidelines\
and standards.\
Overall, it remains true that there are no known welldocumented effects leading to health risks for weak\
induced currents at ELF and \'93non-thermal\'94 RF fields\
levels.\
?? Introduction\
 There has been considerable interest and controversial\
debate in recent years concerning the bioeffects of\
electromagnetic fields (EMF). This is due to some stillunanswered questions about the effect on health of\
increasing levels of exposure of the population to EMF.\
However, the number of experiments, articles, reviews,\
and databases has risen significantly. The quality of the\
research has improved vastly and the knowledge is now\
based on a wide body of data so that ICNIRP1\
, IARC2\
and WHO are or will soon be able to evaluate the\
carcinogenicity and health risks of EMF.\
This review is concerned mainly with animal models of\
cancer. It is divided in two parts related to the ELF and\
RF frequency ranges. It is intended to be complimentary\
to the talk to be given at the Seoul WHO meeting in\
terms of content and mode of presentation.\
Laboratory studies on animals play an essential role in\
evaluating the integrated response of various systems of\
the body, particularly the nervous, endocrine and\
immune systems. These systems are largely responsible\
for homeostasis which maintains the internal\
environment. When challenged by external stimuli, the\
interdependent response of these systems cannot be fully\
defined through in-vitro experiments. However,\
phenomena seen in experimental animals do not\
necessarily imply a health risk for humans. In particular,\
an effect found in only one animal species may be\
specific to that type of animal and not relevant to\
humans.\
Animal studies provide the opportunity to test whether\
lifetime exposure to well-characterised RF causes cancer,\
something that is impossible to do using human\
volunteers. Research on animals can also demonstrate\
influences of RF exposure on susceptibility to cancer\
promotion and progression.\
?? Extremely-low-frequency fields\
A major research effort was launched world-wide to\
determine the possible bioeffects of magnetic and\
electric fields at extremely low frequencies (f < 300 Hz,\
mainly 50/60 Hz corresponding to electricity generation\
and distribution). Following years of scattered projects,\
this research activity has become better co-ordinated on\
the international level, largely thanks to the EMF\
programme of WHO.\
The most recent and comprehensive review on ELF\
bioeffects is that of the RAPID3\
 programme published in\
1998. In 2002, IARC is going to published a monograph\
on the carcinogenicity of ELF fields 4\
. However the\
conclusions of that monograph are already available.5\
Exposure systems\
In the last twenty years, a great number of experiments\
have been performed in laboratories world-wide to\
assess the biological effects of ELF magnetic and\
electric fields. This has led to the design and building of\
several types of exposure systems for in vivo work. The\
goal was to expose the animals to well-characterised\
fields under well-defined environmental factors.\
In view of the mechanisms of interaction of fields with\
biological organisms (mainly induced currents), the\
effects of the magnetic field, which penetrates the body,\
have been the main focus of the research projects, with\
fields strength usually at or below 100 \'b5T.\
In contrast, electric fields do no penetrate the organism\
because of its conductivity, but strong electric fields\
induce polarisation of the cell membrane leading to\
specific effects such as electroporation, which are\
studied in specific exposure systems. This is also true for\
direct stimulation of nerves and other excitable cells\
using electrodes.\
There has been many improvements in the design of\
exposure systems in recent years and it can be stated that\
most of the key exposure parameters described below\
are well-characterised and controlled. However, the\
standardisation of the set-ups is only achieved within\
some of the multi-centre research programmes.\
Large-scale studies on long-term effects of ELF\
magnetic fields on animals have been published in recent\
years. Large facilities have thus been built and run for\
exposure of hundreds of rodents over their lifetime 6 , 7\
(reviewed by Stuchly et al. 8\
). Great care is being taken\
for controlling all environmental factors.\
Genotoxicity\
Effects have been found in different organisms and in\
particular rodents. The work performed by Lai and\
Singh is worth mentioning9\
. These investigators used the\
"comet assay" to detect DNA damage in brain cells from\
ELF-exposed rats. Increases in DNA double- and single\
strand breaks were detected after in vivo exposure to a\
60 Hz magnetic field at 0.1-0.5 mT. These authors also\
indicated that the magnetic-field-induced DNA strand\
breaks were caused by free radicals since a treatment of\
the animals with free radical scavengers blocked the\
effects. In a subsequent investigation10, they also found\
that the magnetic-field apparently induces DNA-protein\
and DNA-DNA cross-links in a manner similar to the\
chemical mitomycin C. These investigations certainly\
need confirmation and further investigation. There have\
been a number of criticisms (also on similar research on\
RF fields) that merit further attention.\
Carcinogenesis\
The controversial issues deduced from epidemio logical\
investigations have spawned many laboratory\
experiments to determine whether EMF can initiate,\
promote or co-promote cancer in animal models.\
There is no evidence that ELF magnetic fields cause\
tumours (\'93initiation\'94), with the possible exception of\
lymphomas arising after exposing rats at high-strength\
fields for three generations\
11 but there are some\
inconsistent indications that EMF exposure might in\
some circumstances suppress or enhance tumour\
development/ growth.\
Overall, no convincing experimental evidence has been\
found to support the hypothesis that exposure to ELF\
magnetic fields increases the risk of cancer. This\
conclusion is well supported by the results of a number\
recent large scale studies of animal carcinogenesis 12\
including those using transgenic animals 13, which have\
generally been more carefully conducted than some of\
the earlier studies reporting either positive or negative\
effects.\
Rodents, particularly mice, have been used extensively\
in studies of adult leukaemogenesis; in spite of the\
absence of a good animal model of the most common\
form of childhood leukaemia, i.e., acute lymphoblastic\
leukaemia. Most studies report a lack of effect of ELF\
magnetic fields on leukaemia or lymphoma in rodents.\
These include several recent, large-scale studies of\
spontaneous tumour incidence in normal and transgenic\
mice 14 , and of radiation-induced lymphoma and\
leukaemia in mice. Further studies found no effect on the\
progression of transplanted leukaemia cells in mice or\
rats.\
Rat mammary carcinomas represent a standard\
laboratory animal model in the study of human breast\
cancer. Three recent large-scale studies of rats showed\
that lifetime magnetic-field exposure had no effect on\
the incidence of spontaneous mammary tumours. The\
evidence concerning EMF effects on chemically-induced\
mammary tumours is more equivocal. Two studies\
suggested that exposure to ELF EMF increase the\
incidence or growth of chemically-induced mammary\
tumours in female rats. 15 However, the work of one\
laboratory was inadequately described and there was\
considerable inter-experimental variability in the results\
from the other laboratory. Two more recent studies have\
not been able to corroborate these findings. 16 Further\
experimental investigation may be warranted to resolve\
this uncertainty.\
Whilst there is no good animal model of spontaneous\
brain tumour, a recent, large scale study reported a lack\
of effect of exposure to power frequency magnetic fields\
on chemically -induced nervous-system tumours in\
female rats 17 . In addition, the low incidence of brain\
cancers in three recent large-scale rat studies was not\
elevated by magnetic field exposure.\
Studies of pre-neoplastic liver lesions and chemicallyinduced skin tumours have been almost uniformly\
negative. In addition, there is no convincing evidence of\
increased malignant conversion. In particular, in three\
recent large-scale studies of ELF magnetic-field effects\
on spontaneous tumour incidence in rodents, the overall\
proportion of malignant tumours tended to be evenly\
distributed between exposed and control animals and\
there was no evidence of a significant trend in doseresponse relationship.11\
Reproduction and development\
Studies have been carried out of the reproductive and\
developmental effects of exposure to ELF electric and\
magnetic field effects using chick and mammalian\
species. With regard to the studies of EMF effects\
during the first 2-3 days of development, the data are\
inconclusive. Positive effects have been reported but\
attempts at replication have mostly been unsuccessful; in\
addition, a number of studies found no effect.\
Studies using mammalian species are more relevant to\
possible effects on humans and overall, the data do not\
support the hypothesis that ELF EMF exposures result in\
reproductive toxicity. Most studies of the effects of\
exposure to power frequency electric fields on the\
development of rodents and miniature swine were\
negative. Similarly, exposure had little effect on rodent\
reproduction and development, although several studies\
noted an increase in the incidence of minor skeletal\
anomalies or variants.\
Endocrine system\
Most animal studies of endocrine function concern the\
pineal gland and melatonin, because of concerns related\
to cancer. Fewer studies have been carried out of ELF\
electromagnetic field effects on the pituitary hormones\
or those of other endocrine glands.\
Some, but not all, studies of power frequency EMF\
effects on rat pineal and serum melatonin levels report\
that exposure to power frequency electric or magnetic\
fields resulted in suppression. The evidence from a\
series of more recent studies by another group reporting\
that circularly polarised magnetic fields suppress night-\
time melatonin levels was sometimes weakened by\
inappropriate comparisons between exposed animals and\
historical controls 18 . The data from other experiments\
was equivocal but mostly negative. The evidence for an\
effect of exposure to ELF EMF on melatonin levels and\
melatonin-dependent reproductive status in seasonally\
breeding animals, Djungarian hamsters and Suffolk\
sheep, is mostly negative. No convincing effect on\
melatonin levels has been seen in a study of non-human\
primates chronically exposed to ELF EMF.\
With the possible exception of transient of minute\
duration, stress following the onset of ELF electric field\
exposure at levels significantly above perception\
thresholds, no consistent effects have been seen in the\
stress-related hormones of the pituitary-adrenal axis in a\
variety of mammalian species.\
Similarly, mostly negative or inconsistent effects have\
been seen in growth hormone levels, levels of hormones\
involved in controlling metabolic activity or associated\
with the control of reproduction and sexual development.\
Few studies have been carried out.\
Immune system\
There is little consistent evidence of any inhibitory effect\
of ELF EMF exposure on various aspects of immu ne\
system functions including those relevant to cancer.\
These included in vivo assays of T-lymphocyte mediated\
immune responsiveness to infection and antigen\
stimulation and, following in vivo exposure, in vitro\
assays of lymphocyte proliferation, of natural killer cell\
activity, macrophage activity, B-lymphocyte (antibody)\
cell activity and differential white blood cell counts.\
Consistently reduced natural killer cell activity was seen\
in female mice exposed to magnetic fields but this effect\
was not seen in male mice nor in male or female rats19\
.\
In addition, EMF-induced changes in tumour incidence\
could not be correlated with any change in immune\
function.\
Nervous system\
Small effects have been reported on peripheral nerve\
function and neuromuscular function following the\
chronic exposure of rats to intense power frequency\
electric fields in well in excess of perception thresholds.\
Intense, pulsed magnetic fields can induce eddy currents\
sufficient to stimulate nerve tissue directly.\
Several papers indicate that exposure to ELF electric\
and/or magnetic fields can change EEG characteristics\
or evoked potential activity. None suggest that the\
effects are hazardous.3\
A few studies have shown effects of ELF electric or\
magnetic field exposure on neurotransmitter levels,\
however, the results are mixed and the effects noted\
relatively small.3\
 Several studies suggest possible EMF\
effects on the opioid and cholinergic systems. These\
effects should be further investigated.\
Conclusion on ELF\
Most reviews indicate that ELF magnetic do not produce\
reproducible effects on animals. However, there is still\
some uncertainty about DMBA models.\
Further work is also needed to test a recent hypothesis\
which is related to the possible effects of contact\
currents experienced in residential environments: these\
currents may affect hematopoiesis and be thus related to\
childhood leukaemia, for which there is so far no\
accepted mechanism.20\
?? Radiofrequency fields\
 The rapid development of mobile telephony in the last\
ten years has led to a large research effort in the RF\
range, aimed at assessing the risks related to both mobile\
telephones and base stations. This followed the\
allegations in the courts and media that mobile\
telephones are a cause of cancer and the public\
objections to the siting of TV, radio and mobile\
telephony antenna because of a fear of cancer.\
Animal testing has contributing significantly to this\
research: at the present time, there are 95 of such studies,\
completed or on-going, listed in the WHO EMF\
database. Several reviews21, 22 and institutional reports23\
have summarised the main findings\
Exposure systems\
Several new exposure systems have been built and\
validated in the recent years for head-only 24 , headmainly or whole-body exposure. The quality of the\
systems has improved vastly and nowdays the exposure\
is well-characterised and uniform.25\
Genotoxic effects\
The energy of RF photons is too weak to break bonds\
and thus cannot affect DNA directly. However, there\
have been investigations of potential epigenetic effects\
(indirect) at low-level.\
Micronuclei: No effect was seen on blood cells in mice\
exposed at 2.45-GHz for 18 months at a whole -body\
SAR of 1 W/kg 26 . Few other such studies have been\
performed in vivo.\
Chromosomal aberration: Most experiments on whole\
animals have shown no increase in chromosomal\
aberration after exposure, even at high intensities\
corresponding to a rise in body temperature.\
DNA damage: An increase in the number of DNA\
breaks was reported in the brain cells of rats exposed for\
two hours to pulsed or continuous-wave 2.45-GHz\
microwaves using the \'93comet\'94 assay.27 However, several\
replications studies have since failed.28\
Mutation: A large number of studies on animals have\
consistently failed to demonstrate mutation of somatic\
cells after exposure to RF microwaves even at high\
levels.\
Cancer\
Spontaneous tumour incidence: There were no effects\
observed in several rodent studies in normal animals but\
possible effects in transgenic mice as reported by the\
Repacholi group using transgenic mice prone to develop\
lymphomas 29 . Replication of this study and extension\
with more complete follow-up and improved dosimetry\
is currently under way in Australia and Italy 30. Another\
In case of replication, one will need to further assess the\
relevance of these findings for human health. Other\
authors have reported a lack of effect of RF exposure on\
cancer incidence in mice prone to mammary tumours.31,\
32\
Promotion studies: The many co-promotion studies that\
have been performed using chemically-induced tumours\
have been consistently negative.33\
,\
34 There are several\
more such studies under way.\
Progression of injected tumours: The few studies on\
injected tumours have been negative.\
Melatonin: There are so far too few studies on melatonin\
levels in animals to draw ant firm conclusions. However,\
most of these studies were negative.\
Conclusions on cancer: Some caution is required before\
dismissing effects on cancer completely as positive\
results were found in a few studies.\
Acute effects on the nervous system\
Gene expression\
Consistent changes have been seen only with heating35\
but studies with transgenic worms suggest otherwise. 36\
Further work on HSP expression is claerly needed as\
evidenced also in recent in vitro results\
Blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability\
results of studies on the permeability of the BBB have\
mainly negative 37 but some positive effects have been\
reported 38 and further work is on-going in several\
laboratories.\
Conclusions\
Regarding data obtained on cancer in animal models\

Photochromic fuzzy logic systems have been designed that extend human visual perception into the UV region. The systems are founded on a detailed knowledge of the activation wavelengths and quantum yields of a series of thermally reversible photochromic compounds. By appropriate matching of the photochromic behaviour unique colour signatures are generated in response differing UV activation frequencies.\
\
A deep scientific understanding of how the human brain perceives, thinks, and acts will have a revolutionary impact in science, medicine, economic growth, security and well-being as recently expounded by an interdisciplinary and international team lead by Albus.1 Perception plays a relevant role within the cognitive architecture of the human nervous system. In fact, it builds and maintains an internal model of the external world and conditions behavior.2 Among the different sensory systems, we have at our disposal, the visual system is remarkable because it allows us to discern colour, shape and the movement of objects.3 Human colour perception is founded upon a mosaic of many replicas of three types of photosensitive cells, termed cones. Each type of cone absorbs a particular region of the visible spectrum, although their spectra partly overlap. There is a type of cone that absorbs mainly blue light (with an absorbance peak at 420 nm), another that absorbs green wavelengths (with an absorbance peak at 530 nm), and a third type that absorbs up into the red region (with an absorbance peak at 565 nm). When light, having a particular spectral power distribution, impinges on the retina, it activates each of the three types of cones by differing degrees. The distribution of the degrees of activation of the three types of cones is information that travels as electrochemical signals up to the visual cortex. In the visual cortex, information is encoded as a specific pattern of activity of the cortical neurons in layer 4 of the V1 area.4\'967 Metameric matches8 occur when different spectral signals lead to the same activation patterns in the three types of cones and to the same pattern of activity in the visual cortex; thus, the different spectral signals appear to represent the same colour. Of course, the overall information about the colours within our brain is not limited to a simple correspondence between pigment activation and the spectrum of light. In fact, neuro-physiological evidence, such as colour constancy and coloured shadows, reveal the existence of post-receptor mechanisms for colour information processing.9,10 As far as the receptor mechanisms of colour perception are concerned, these mechanisms can be modelled by invoking the theory of fuzzy logic.11,12 Fuzzy logic is a mathematically rigorous model useful to describe the human computational ability which presently uses words and imprecise reasoning.13 It is based on the theory of fuzzy sets proposed by Zadeh 50 years ago.14 A fuzzy set is more than a \'93classical\'94 set because it can not only wholly include or wholly exclude elements, but it can also partially include and exclude other elements. A fuzzy set breaks the law of excluded middle, because an element may belong to both a fuzzy set and its complement. The degree of membership (\uc0\u956 ) of an element to a fuzzy set can be any real number included between 0 and 1. Fuzzy logic describes any non-linear complex input\'96output relations after building a fuzzy logic system. A fuzzy logic system consists of a collection of input fuzzy sets, a collection of output fuzzy sets, and a fuzzy inference engine that links, through syllogistic statements of the type \'93if\'85, then\'85\'94, each input fuzzy set to a particular output fuzzy set. The cones on the retina behave like input fuzzy sets: a beam of light impinging upon the retina belongs to the cellular fuzzy sets to different degrees, depending on its spectral power distribution. On the other hand, output fuzzy sets are made of clusters of patterns of activity of cortical neurons that are interpreted as the same colour. The fuzzy inference engine is the mechanism of transduction of the electrochemical information stored by the photoreceptor cells in the information encoded as patterns of activity of cortical neurons. This description is useful for the design of biologically inspired chemical systems for UV vision.\
Humans cannot perceive UV radiation because the lens and cornea of the eye absorb strongly in this wavelength region preventing UV radiation from reaching the retina. However, a wide variety of animal species show sensitivity to UV, ranging from insects to mammals. Most often, the species that see UV are provided with a specific photoreceptor peaked around 350 nm in the UV-A region.15,16 UV sensitivity is useful in activities as diverse as navigation, intra- and inter-species communication, foraging and circadian synchronization. A remarkable case is the mantis shrimp that has at least four types of photoreceptors for UV in addition to eight for the visible region, as befits its habitat of kaleidoscopically colourful tropical coral reefs.17\
\
In this work, we present the synthesis, study and optimized combinations of five thermally reversible photochromic compounds (1\'965) that generate biologically inspired fuzzy logic systems useful to transform the frequencies of the UV spectrum, invisible to us, into specific colours perceptible to the human eye. The photochromic compounds are 1,3-dihydro-1,3,3-trimethyl-8\uc0\u8242 -nitro-spiro[2H-indole-2,3\u8242 -[3H]naphth[2,1-b][1,4]oxazine] (1), 2,2-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-5,6-dimethyl-2H-naphtho[1,2-b]pyran (2), 6-morpholino-3-(4-morpholinophenyl)-3-phenyl-3H-naphtho[2,1-b]pyran (3), 3,3-diphenyl-6-morpholino-3H-naphtho[2,1-b]pyran (4), 3-(2-fluorophenyl)-3-(4-pyrrolidinophenyl)-3H-naphtho[2,1-b]pyran (5). Their structures and the colours of their solutions containing their ring-opened forms after UV irradiation are shown in Fig. 1.\
\
Fig. 1 Structures of the five closed uncoloured (1c\'965c) photochromic compounds and their ring-opened coloured forms (1o\'965o). The pictures show the colours they produce in MeCN solutions upon UV irradiation.	\
The absorption spectra of the closed uncoloured forms are depicted in Fig. 2A. Naphthoxazine 1 has the largest absorption coefficient in the UV-A (320\'96400 nm) and almost in the entire UV-B region (280\'96320 nm). In the portion of UV-C included between 250 and 280 nm that will be considered in this work, the absorption of 1 is overwhelmed by the contributions of the other four naphthopyrans. Naphtho[2,1-b]pyrans 3 and 4 have fairly similar absorption spectra in the UV-A; in UV-B and UV-C regions, 3 absorbs more than 4 due to the presence of a morpholino group bound to one of the two phenyl rings (see Fig. 1). Naphtho[1,2-b]pyran 2 is characterized by small values of the absorption coefficient in the range 387\'96294 nm. Compound 5 is the naphtho[2,1-b]pyran that commences absorption at the shortest wavelengths among the other photochromes. Upon UV irradiation (see Fig. 2B), 1 gives rise to a merocyanine that has an absorption band with a maximum at 610 nm and its solution becomes blue; 5 generates a band having a maximum at 554 nm and its solution becomes purple; 2 produces a band in the visible region which peaks at 497 nm and its solution becomes pink; 3 gives rise to a band centred at 463 nm and its solution becomes orange; finally, 4 generates a narrow band with a maximum at 413 nm and its solution appears yellow. The band due to 1 has an absorption coefficient at 610 nm that is more than four times larger than the values of the other coloured species; it is generally accepted that photochromic oxazines typically afford ring-opened species, which are more hyperchromic and bathochromic than those derived from diarylnaphthopyrans.18\'9621\

Fig. 2 Quantitative absorption spectra (recorded in MeCN) of the closed uncoloured (A) and open coloured (B) forms of 1 (black traces), 3 (red traces), 4 (green traces), 2 (magenta traces), and 5 (blue traces).	\
The photochemical quantum yields (\uc0\u934 PC) of the five photochromic compounds have been determined by irradiating at different wavelengths in the UV. The experimental methodology followed for their determination is described in the ESI.\'86 The results are listed in Table 1. For all compounds, \u934 PC in the UV-C region is larger than \u934 PC in UV-A and UV-B regions. This is particularly true in the case of naphthopyrans. In fact, naphthopyrans are known to give ultrafast electrocyclic ring opening reactions that kinetically compete with the other unreactive relaxation pathways and their photochemical quantum yields are usually wavelength-dependent.22 Simulations of the absorption spectra by density functional theory computation (DFT, see ESI\'86) reveal that the electronic transitions in UV-A and UV-B involve mainly the naphthopyran rings, whereas those in UV-C have charge transfer character from the naphthopyran rings to the two phenyl groups bound to the sp3 carbon atom in the pyran ring. The open forms produced by irradiating with UV have lifetimes of tens of seconds, which are independent of the frequency of irradiation (see data in Table 1). In particular, the open form of 5 has the shortest lifetime, lasting 19 s, whereas the open form of 4 is approximately three times more persistent.\

With knowledge of the spectral and photochemical properties of the five photochromes, some or all of them can be mixed in different ratios to create chemical systems able to transform the frequencies of the UV-A, UV-B and UV-C regions into different colours. The matching criteria are founded upon two considerations. First, the absorption bands of the uncoloured forms must be conceived as input fuzzy sets and the irradiation intensity I0(\uc0\u955 irr) at \u955 irr will belong to each of them with a degree (\u956 UV,i) given by:\
\
 \
is the intensity absorbed by the uncoloured form of the i-th species whose absorption coefficient is \uc0\u949 Un,i and whose analytical concentration is C0,i. Second, the bands in the visible region produced by the open forms behave as output fuzzy sets. The contribution in absorbance of each coloured species at the wavelength \u955 an belonging to the visible region will be:\
 \
image file: c5cc09290f-t1.tif	(2)\
where k\uc0\u916 ,i is the reciprocal of the lifetime of the i-th open form. The final absorption spectrum recorded at the photo-stationary state will be the sum of as many terms represented by eqn (2) as there are photochromic components present in the mixture. Of course, the sum must be extended to all the wavelengths (\u955 an) belonging to the visible spectrum.\
Many combinations of photochromes 1\'965, containing from three to five compounds and selected by applying eqn (1) and (2), have been found effective in distinguishing the three principal UV regions: UV-A (400\'96320 nm) from UV-B (320\'96280 nm) and from UV-C with \uc0\u955  \u8805  250 nm. One of the best systems was a quaternary mixture involving 1, 4, 5, and 2 in concentrations of 5.2 \'d7 10\u8722 5 M, 7.38 \'d7 10\u8722 5 M, 1.4 \'d7 10\u8722 4 M, and 1.4 \'d7 10\u8722 4 M, respectively. Its discriminative power is shown in Fig. 3. When the system is irradiated by frequencies belonging to UV-A, the solution becomes green; under UV-B, the solution turns to grey, and under UV-C irradiation with wavelengths longer than 250 nm, it becomes orange. The spectra recorded at the photo-stationary states, shown as the grey dashed traces in the bottom panels of Fig. 3, are accurately reproducible by summing the spectral contribution of each species, expressed by eqn (2) (see the red dashed traces in the same panels). Eqn (2) provides a powerful means to predict the observed colour when the mixture is irradiated by many UV frequencies, simultaneously. For example, in Fig. 4, the experimental (grey dashed traces) and predicted (red dashed traces) spectra obtained under different polychromatic irradiation frequencies are compared.\
\

Continuous traces represent the calculated spectral contribution of 1 (black), 4 (green), 2 (magenta), 5 (blue); their algebraic sum gives the red dashed traces. The grey dashed traces represent the spectra recorded experimentally using 125 W Xe lamp as irradiation source. In the three plots, \uc0\u916 A is obtained by subtracting the spectrum recorded at the photo-stationary state from the initial one; (A/I0) represents the total absorbance into the visible calculated by eqn (2), divided by the total intensity (I0) at \u955 irr.	\
\
Fig. 4 Response of the quaternary photochromic fuzzy logic system to electromagnetic radiation belonging to different regions of UV. In each panel, the left-hand side plot represents the spectrum of the irradiation source, whereas the plot on the right shows the experimental spectrum (grey dashed trace) compared with the calculated spectrum (red dashed trace) obtained by summing the contributions of 1 (black continuous trace), 4 (green continuous trace), 2 (magenta continuous trace) and 5 (blue continuous trace). On the right-hand plot of each panel there is also a picture of the irradiated solution (inset). The top-left panel is relative to direct sunlight at 11 a.m.; the top-right panel is relative to direct sunlight at 11 a.m. plus irradiation at 254 nm emitted by a Hg lamp (inset); the bottom-left-hand panel is relative to skylight and the bottom-right panel is relative to skylight plus irradiation at 254 nm emitted by a Hg lamp (inset).	\
Under direct sunlight (see top-left panel), the solution becomes orange, and the experimental spectrum can be readily reproduced if we consider that the closed forms of 1 and 4 are completely transformed into their open forms by UV-A, whereas 2 and 5 are completely converted into their coloured forms by UV-B. When we add the contribution of the radiation at 254 nm, emitted by the Hg lamp (see plot B1 in Fig. 4), the solution turns red because of the higher \uc0\u934 PC of 2 and 5 in the UV-C region. When the solution is irradiated by skylight but not direct sunlight, it assumes a pale green colour because the spectrum of skylight is deficient in UV-B (see plot C1 in Fig. 4). When we add the 254 nm wavelength emitted by the Hg lamp to the spectrum of skylight, the colour of the solution turns red because the very intense UV-C radiation quantitatively transforms the closed forms of 2 and 5 to their respective open structures. In fact, 2 and 5 have higher probabilities of absorbing the 254 nm radiation because they are at higher concentration in the mixture.\
\
The performance of the Biologically Inspired Photochromic Fuzzy Logic (BIPFUL) systems investigated in acetonitrile solutions can be extended to a solid cellulose support as in white paper. After soaking a sheet of filter paper in an acetonitrile solution of the quaternary mixture described above, and after drying, the impregnated paper becomes photochromic and UV selective. It is possible to write on the paper by using UV radiation, and it is possible to change colour by appropriate tuning of the frequency of the irradiation source. For example, Fig. 5 shows a green A, a grey B and an orange C written on sheets of paper by irradiating them through negative masks and with radiation belonging to UV-A, UV-B or UV-C, respectively. If the UV source is turned off, the letters slowly (in roughly 30 minutes) disappear.\
\

This work has demonstrated for the first time that solutions of carefully matched thermoreversible photochromic compounds are chemical systems having the emergent property of discriminating the three UV regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. These results contribute to the development of Systems Chemistry24 and Chemical Artificial Intelligence.25,26 In fact, the BIPFUL systems described herein mimic the computing power of vertebrates and invertebrates that have different photoreceptors to distinguish between frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum. Recently, de Silva et al.,27 demonstrated that the parallel processing by the combination of a pH sensor and a photo-acid generator detects the edges of objects, which is a rather complex computational task normally requiring a highly organized biomolecular system. This paper constitutes a further demonstration of how simple molecular logic systems, such as the photochromic compounds defined as \'93optical transistors\'94,28\'9631 can give rise to high-level computing performances. We have shown that our BIPFUL systems can work not only in solution but also on a solid cellulosic support such as a sheet of inexpensive filter paper. Therefore, these photochromic systems are promising for designing new devices distinguishing UV frequencies in a photochemical manner instead of photo-electrically as with the use of semiconductors.32 Such photochemical UV detectors can be directly linked to human vision through the colours they produce and can supplement the performance of our visual system, enabling a further degree of detection and discrimination.}{\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252\cocoartf2577

1 Introduction\
Research on biological and health effects of electromagnetic fields (EMFs) has been driven in the last few decades by public\
concerns about their potential detrimental effects. Up to date, an extensive application of EMFs, for both diagnostic and therapeutic purpose, has taken hold as well, moving the attention from the sole aspect of health protection.\
EMFs sources are broadly diffused in the environment, varying both in emission intensity and frequency range (see Figure 1 for\
EM spectrum visualization). Static fields (SF at 0 frequency or namely DC, see Figure 1) are naturally associated to the earth\
surface, weather changes, and solar activity. Nonnaturally derived fields come from household and office appliances, video\
displays, power transmission lines, industrial processes, and medical and research applications (Magnetic Resonance\
Imaging, MRI).\
High voltage lines and all the electric devices are also the principal sources of extremely low frequency fields (ELF, o300 Hz,\
see Figure 1), operating at 50 Hz (Europe) or 60 Hz (America), commonly present in our daily life. Within particular occupational\
situations, such as industrial machines, induction ovens, or electrolytic cells, workers can be exposed to high electric or magnetic\
fields intensities.\
Exposure to intermediate frequency (IF, 300 Hzofr10 kHz, see Figure 1) fields has been so far limited to specific situations,\
but emerging technologies, such as anti-theft devices, badge readers, induction hotplates, or fluorescent bulbs, producing IF\
emissions, are now amply diffused.\
In the radiofrequency (RF, 10 kHzofr300 GHz, see Figure 1) range, natural sources are essentially represented by electrical\
discharges in the atmosphere and solar and cosmic radiation. Human exposure, along with domestic and indoor transmitters, lay\
essentially on portable wireless telecommunication systems; mobile phones remain the main source of exposure for brain tissues.\
RF EMF levels are not going to rise, having new technologies, like digital broadcasting, reduced EMF exposure from far field sources\
(radio and TV broadcasting and mobile phones base stations). The current tendency is to make use of devices at close contact with\
human body but of lower emissions, working at higher frequencies than GSM.\
This classification does not rule out the fact that in real life the EMF exposure is often due to multiple sources acting\
contemporaneously at different frequencies. However, few available studies on combined exposure to EMF of different frequency\

\f0 Change History: February 2015. C. Marino, P. Galloni, and C. Merla replaced Table 1 with Figure 1. Several new sections have been added to the original\
version to make the article up to date. In the Further Reading section, several references have been added to the former list.\

ranges have been carried out and they do not provide sufficient information to challenge existing risk assessment; in addition, in\
most experiments an absence of effects has been reported.\
Another important issue is the combination of EMF exposure with other physical (e.g., ultrasound and ionizing radiation) or\
chemical agents. However, the reports on combined effects lack consistency and are not linked to specific experimental conditions.\
Therefore, further research is needed in order to clarify any relevance of combined exposures, especially to human cancer risk under\
real life exposure situations, and to explore the potentially beneficial (protective) effects of such exposures. In next paragraphs brief\
indication will be given also on these aspects when available.\
Explicit distinctions must be made between the concepts of interaction, biological effect, and health hazard, consistent with the\
criteria used by international bodies when making health assessments: biological effects occur when fields interact to produce\
responses that may or may not be experienced by people. Deciding whether biological changes have health consequences depends,\
in part, on whether they are reversible, are within the range for which the body has effective compensation mechanisms, or are\
likely, taking into account the variability of response among individuals, to lead to unfavorable changes in health. World health\
organization (WHO) defines health as the state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of\
disease or infirmity. Not all biological effects are hazardous: some may be innocuously within the normal range of biological\
variation and physiological compensation. Others may be beneficial under certain conditions, and the health implications of\
others may be simply indeterminate. In this document a health hazard is defined as a biological effect outside the normal range of\
physiological compensation and adverse to well-being.\
It is known that EM interference with electromedical devices, such as cardiac pacemakers, leads to adverse health consequences,\
but this review is only concerned with direct effects of EMFs on living tissues.\
The scientific approaches to health risk assessment related to non-ionizing EMFs are the same as in the ionizing range and\
toxicology in general, i.e., epidemiology, experimental studies on humans, animals, and cells in culture.\
Many effects on biological systems exposed to EM fields have been reported. In the last 30 years, numerous experiments have\
been performed in laboratories worldwide to assess the biological effects of EM fields. This has led to the design and building of\
several types of exposure systems for in vitro, in vivo, and human studies. The goal is to expose the biological samples (mainly cell\
cultures and animals) to well-characterized fields under well-defined environmental conditions. Indeed, it is now internationally\
recognized that exposure setups have to be of sufficient quality to warrant that biological findings were not due to physical\
artifacts. Exposure setups, further, have to guarantee suitable arrangements for blind sham (i.e., without EM field) exposures. There\
have been many improvements in the design of exposure systems in recent years and most of the key parameters described below\
are well-characterized and controlled. However, standardization of these systems has only been achieved within some of the multicenter research programmes.\
This article gives a review of the existing scientific knowledge on the biological and health effects of EMFs for the most part in\
the two main frequency ranges of concern: ELF and RF. A brief section will be devoted to the other frequency intervals as SF and IF\
sources for which only limited studies are up to now available.\

2 Bioeffects of Static Fields\
SF interact with moving charged particles, such as ions, and with magnetic moments arising from the orbital motions of electrons\
in atoms. SF can interact with paramagnetic elements in the body (metals and molecules as hemoglobin or ferritin) and modify\
chemical reaction rates. Most of the tissues in the body can conduct electricity, but in ordinary conditions currents flow only in\
particular tissues, as to say nerves, muscles, and excitable cells. Eddy currents can be induced by external SF if the biological tissue\
is moving in relation to the field, for example for body movements or blood flow. Manifest effects of interaction with SF are\
reported, including peripheral nerve stimulation, perturbation of the vestibular system (dizziness), magnetophosphenes, or\
metallic taste, but are often related to high levels of exposure (over 2\'968 T to evoke vertigo and other sensory perceptions or\
peripheral nerve stimulations respectively).\
2.1 Cellular Models\
Strong SF (40.2 T) have been tested in different in vitro systems for various exposure durations, evidencing that magnetic fields can\
orientate both cells and macromolecules. Genotoxic potential has been evaluated failing to show effects, while gene expression\
was reported to be up-regulated in different investigations. An increased sensitivity to harmful agents was reported in studies of\
combined exposure.\
2.2 Animal Models\
Cancer-related endpoints, reproduction, development, physiological, and behavioral responses have been studied after SF exposure in vivo. Concerning carcinogenicity, long-term investigations were performed only with relatively weak SF, drawing inconclusive results. Few high-quality studies with low intensity SF (o1 T) on fertility, growth, and development have been performed,\
showing no consistent adverse effects. Some effects were reported for studies on the cardiovascular system (evidencing, for\
example, generation of electric potentials across arteries), but their physiological consequences are unsure. Publications from a\
single laboratory evidenced behavioral and neural changes (i.e., vestibular disorder) for exposure above 4\'967 T.\
2.3 Human Studies\
Epidemiological investigation, trials, and case-report studies do not suggest long-term adverse health effects due to SF exposure. A\
small evidence of increase in leukemia risk in electrolytic plants workers was reported. Only limited evidence exists (only one\
study) for an increase of metallic taste or vertigo in people working in MRI facilities.\
3 Bioeffects of ELF Fields\
In view of the interaction processes of fields with biological organisms (mainly induced electric fields at ELF), the effects of external\
magnetic fields, which penetrate the body, have been the main focus of the research projects. In contrast, external electric fields at\
ELF do not penetrate well the organism because of its conductivity. This is not true for direct stimulation of nerves and other\
excitable cells using electrodes. Electric fields (mainly E pulses of ms up to ms in duration) can also induce polarization of the cell\
membranes leading to specific effects such as electroporation.\
Many mechanisms have been proposed through which living systems could interact with electric and magnetic fields at low\
frequencies. However, both laboratory studies and controlled human studies have provided evidence mainly for electrically-based\
phenomena that occur in the presence of ELF fields and that are present only during exposure to these fields. However, a great\
interest in direct magnetic field effects on biochemical reactions has recently undergone a further increase because of very accurate\
experimental evidences associated with avian magneto-reception involving Cryptochromes. These studies suggest the involvement\
of a radical pair in the reaction cascade and, hence, the plausible role of direct magnetic field effects.\
Induced electric signals in tissues of the nervous and visual system of animals exposed to ELF electric and magnetic fields can\
produce effects that lead to field perception. The most notable effect that occurs in humans exposed to fields of moderate intensity\
is the induction of visual phosphenes. The neuronal circuits of the retina form a part of the CNS and thus the magneto-phosphene\
threshold may be taken as a realistic indicator of the threshold value for functional changes induced in other parts of the\
CNS. Threshold values at 20 Hz were estimated at approximately 100 mV m1\
. Direct effects on the peripheral nervous system\
occur only at relatively high levels of electrical stimulation (about 2 V m1 and with increasing thresholds for frequencies above\
1 kHz).\
A variety of other potential mechanisms for interaction of ELF electric and magnetic fields with living systems have been\
proposed, but not demonstrated to produce effects that could significantly perturb normal biological functions. Examples of such\
interactions are the following: (1) magneto-chemical interactions with charge-transfer reactions which do not appear to influence\
biochemical pathways such as those involving electron transport; and (2) resonance interactions involving combined static and\

ELF fields in specific geometric configurations have not been shown to have significant biological effects, consistent with predictions based on well-founded physical arguments.\
3.1 Cellular Models\
There is a large and varied body of research literature on the ability of fields to cause changes in cellular models. In vitro studies\
were extensively performed and published up to 2000. More recent results suggest that, overall, the evidence for stimulation of cell\
division by ELF fields is at best equivocal. Neither is there clear evidence that ELF magnetic fields can alter calcium ion homeostasis. Finally, the data on several aspects of intracellular signaling do not consistently support the existence of field effects on\
these signaling pathways. Furthermore, the types of effects reported, when found, have been of a magnitude that gives little\
support to the conclusion that they are of consequence for human health.\
Redox-related mechanisms have been mainly documented for ELF, studies proposed that exposure can stabilize free radicals\
increasing their lifetime and allowing a wider dispersion rather than their return to the basal level. Super oxide production in\
mouse macrophage was also detected after ELF exposure in a dose-dependent manner. Thus considering evidence from various\
authors, it seems plausible that reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation could be well-considered as an in vitro model for\
interaction between ELF and biological systems.\
3.2 Animal Models\
Overall, a large number of studies have been carried out, testing many different biological endpoints in a variety of animal species.\
With regard to genotoxicity, there is no clear evidence that exposure to ELF magnetic fields presents an hazard. Relatively few\
animal studies have been carried out, however, and the subject has been more extensively investigated at the cellular level (see\
above). Similarly, no convincing evidence has been found from experimental studies supporting the hypothesis that exposure to\
power-frequency magnetic fields increases the risk of cancer.\
Many studies have dealt with the reproductive and developmental effects of exposure to power frequency electric and magnetic\
field effects and VLF visual-display-frequency magnetic fields using chicks and mammalian species. Overall, the data do not\
support the hypothesis that low-frequency EMF exposures result in reproductive toxicity.\
Generally, the evidence for an effect of exposure to power-frequency EMFs on melatonin levels and melatonin-dependent\
reproductive status is mostly negative in seasonally-breeding animals. In addition, no convincing effect on melatonin levels has\
been seen in a study of non-human primates chronically exposed to power-frequency EMFs. The interpretation of the outcome of\
studies on rat pineal and serum melatonin levels was more problematic: both positive and negative effects were reported in studies\
without apparent technical or analytical deficits.\
With regard to possible effects on other hormones, with the possible exception of transient stress following the onset of ELF\
electric field exposure at levels significantly above perception thresholds, no consistent effects have been observed in levels\
of the stress-related hormones of the pituitary\'96adrenal axis, growth hormone levels, levels of hormones involved in controlling\
metabolic activity or those associated with the control of reproduction and sexual development. Results of these studies are\
inconsistent and contradictory, reporting no effects or either an increase or a decrease of the normal hormones concentration.\
There is little consistent evidence of any inhibitory effect of ELF EMF exposure on various aspects of immune system function\
including those relevant to cancer. In addition, there was no compelling evidence that hematological variables were affected by\
exposure to ELF fields.\
In general, many studies of nervous system functions were either negative, or difficult to interpret because of weakness in\
experimental design or confounding by artifact. However, several studies suggest possible EMF effects on the opioid and cholinergic systems, along with concomitant changes in analgesia and in the acquisition and performance of spatial memory tasks.\
Effects on opioid and cholinergic systems should thus be further investigated.\
Action of free radicals in brain under ELF exposure was fully analyzed in a recent review evidencing, in particular, redox and\
trophic responses in mouse brain and brain lipid oxidative damage. Moreover, antioxidant defense can be specifically deteriorated\
by ELF exposure thus amplifying oxidative stress both in young and aged rat brain. However, a direct link to health risk assessment\
of these results is difficult due to the limited number of conducted studies\
Hypotheses relating ELF to neurodegenerative diseases are a relatively novel part of the EMF research area and, so far, only a\
modest number of studies have been performed if compared to cancer research field. A single study on animals, genetically\
modified rodents for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), was performed to assess the possible effects of chronic exposure to ELF\
on the development of this neurodegenerative disease. Authors did not reveal any difference between exposed and control\
animals, providing no evidence of a link between ELF and ALS in an oxidative prone experimental model. Connection with\
Huntington\'92s disease (HD) was also investigated in vivo. These data together other observations seem to support the hypothesis of\
a neuro-protective effect elicited by ELF on HD.\
The potential sensitivity of people with epilepsy to EMF exposure is an important factor that should be considered. Exposure of\
animals to EMFs before testing has been reported to have an inhibitory effect on subsequent tests of epileptic-seizure sensitivity\
but the type of response was not consistent among different studies. Further investigation should be carried out of possible effects\
during exposure.\
4 Biological Effects of Electromagnetic Fields\

Moreover, ELF seems related to the offset and onset of evoked potentials, this suggests that the field was transduced like\
ordinary stimuli such as light and sound. However, the changes induced by ELF were governed by nonlinear and complex law for\
which the underlying mechanism still remains unknown.\
There is convincing evidence that ELF electric fields can be perceived by animals, most likely as a result of surface charge effects;\
threshold values for both rats and baboons lie between about 5 and15 kV m1\
. Exposures above these thresholds are sufficient to\
be mildly aversive and will result in transient arousal but mostly disappear following prolonged exposure.\
Largely consistent with earlier results, recent studies have reported that exposure to magnetic fields has no effect on activity or\
locomotion, but may affect the performance of spatial memory tasks (both deficits and improvements have been reported) and\
engender subtle increases in behavioral anxiety and stress. Other studies have investigated potential molecular and cellular\
mechanisms, and despite a number of studies continuing to report candidate mechanisms, particularly regarding effects on ROS,\
none that operate at levels of exposure found in the everyday environment has been firmly identified.\
3.3 Human Studies\
Small inconsistent changes have been described in circulating levels of leukocytes, but as with animals, the relevance to human\
health of these changes is not clear. No indication of a clear-cut cytogenetic effect was observed in the blood cells of exposed\
subjects. The circulating hormone levels in humans, including melatonin, are not adversely affected by exposure to powerfrequency electric and/or magnetic fields. At the same time, two recent independent studies have examined the effects of occupational exposure to magnetic fields by examining peripheral blood of exposed workers. At best, these provide only weak evidence\
for a field-related effect on natural killer cell activity and antioxidant activity.\
Positive results from studies on the power spectrum of different EEG frequency bands and on sleep structure have been\
performed at occupational exposure levels higher than general environmental levels.\
In the light of cognitive and performance studies that show a large number of positive biological effects the need for further\
studies is warranted in order to clarify their significance for human health.\
Some authors investigated the possible effects of fields generated by electric motors in incubators on autonomic function in\
newborn babies. Transient changes in the total power and spectral components of heart rate variability (HRV) were noted when\
the motors were running. Confirmatory studies are required to determine the significance of this observation. Others reported that\
HRV in adults was affected by exposure to very weak fields (around 2 mT). The direction of change was dependent on the frequency\
used. The majority of published cardiovascular changes stay within the range of normal biological variations; else, the study\
protocols and the results have not been successfully replicated in other laboratories.\
More recently, it has been hypothesized that exposure to low frequency fields is associated with several neurodegenerative\
diseases. For Alzheimer\'92s disease (AD) and ALS more studies have been published, while lack of data and inconsistency emerged\
for diseases as Parkinson (PD). Some of these reports concerning Alzheimer and ALS suggest that people employed in electrical\
occupations might have an increased risk. So far, no biological mechanism has been established which can explain this association, although it could have arisen because of confounders related to electrical occupations, such as electric shocks. However\
more sophisticated studies do not observed increasing of the risk. Hence, overall the evidence for the association between low\
frequency exposure and AD and ALS is inconclusive.\
Only few new studies have been published since the previous opinion and they do not provide support to increase the risk\
for AD.\
As perception of electric or magnetic fields has been reasonably well characterized, skin symptoms, headache, and mood\
disturbance claimed by working near computer screens or in proximity of other environmental ELF sources have not reliably been\
linked to any electromagnetic exposure produced by these devices. Also, reported studies do not indicate any ability of individuals\
who alleged electromagnetic hypersensitivity to react to any test-field situation, suggesting that other environmental or psychosocial factors should be considered for people suffering from this pathology.\
3.4 Conclusions\
There is today little scientific evidence suggesting that ELF EMF exposures pose a health risk. The strongest evidence for health\
effects comes from an association observed with childhood leukemia. In contrast, mechanistic studies and animal toxicology data\
fail to demonstrate any consistent pattern across studies, although sporadic findings of biological effects (including increased\
cancers in animals) have been reported.\
This was at the basis of a classification performed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer in 2001, ranking ELF\
magnetic fields as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B) (IARC, 2002). The classifications essentially were based on the\
facts that epidemiological studies showed a consistent association between magnetic fields above approximately 0.3/0.4 mT and a\
doubling in risk for childhood leukemia, although chance, bias and confounding could not be ruled out as an explanation with\
reasonable confidence, but that experimental studies or mechanistic modeling provided little support for, or explanation of, these\
findings.\
The lack of connection between human and experimental data (animal and mechanistic) severely complicates the interpretation of these results.\

4 Bioeffects of IF Fields\
For the purposes of risk assessment, IF fields have only been considered as a separate entity relatively recently. Largely depending\
on the definition of their frequency range, IF fields have been considered in various reviews and monographs alongside either low\
or high frequency fields. IF fields can induce electric fields and currents in the human body, much as it is seen with low frequency\
fields, but they can also induce heating effects in the body as in high frequency field exposures. Assessments of possible hazards at\
IF are based primarily on extrapolation from data on exposure to higher and lower frequencies. Very little useful epidemiological\
data are available. The existing evidence largely comes from older studies that tended to used job title as a surrogate for exposure.\
Groups studied include users of visual display units (VDUs) associated with personal computers and radio and telegraph\
operators. Outcomes studied included cancer as well as effects on the eye, the cardiovascular system and the reproductive system.\
Although no particular risks were identified, the quality of existing studies is limited. There have been some animal studies\
exploring the effects of IF fields from VDUs, particularly on reproduction and development. There are fewer studies on humans,\
although some studies have investigated effects of IF fields on skin. With the demise of cathode-ray based monitors, more recent\
work exploring health risks associated with computer use in humans has concentrated on ergonomic issues (and is not considered\
here). Despite some limited evidence from animal studies that have reported field-dependent effects on reproduction and\
development, there is no consistent or conclusive evidence of field-dependent adverse effects. Overall, it can be concluded that\
there was insufficient data for a health risk assessment, so the overall evaluation for all health endpoints has to be considered to be\
inadequate. Since then, an IARC Working Group has classified EMFs with a frequency range of 30 kHz to 300 GHz as being\
\'91possibly carcinogenic to humans' (see Section 5).\
4.1 Cellular Models\
In vitro IF exposure of a single work on genotoxicity gives negative results as well as stress responses on glioblastoma cells. Negative\
effects was also obtained for global gene expression on human astroglia cell line.\
4.2 Animal Models\
A series of study of IF exposure effects on embryotic development was carried out recently with negative outcomes. Globally, no\
effects on reproductive outcome were documented in these studies.\
5 Bioeffects of RF Fields\
Concerns about health effects caused by exposure to RF are mainly related to mobile telephones and base stations, becoming a\
major societal issue in some countries, or at least among part of the population. Mobile (or cellular) telephony has developed very\
rapidly, followed and unseated in the last years by phones equipped for data services (smart phones, 3G). They are now part of the\
basic equipment of modern life and billions of such devices are in use worldwide. Stories about health risks from radiofrequency\
radiation (RFR) from mobile phones and base stations have become common in the media over the past 10 years.\
Several systems are used in mobile telephony worldwide, all based on the same principle, i.e., \'91cellular\'92 mapping of the\
territory. In each cell, a base station (BTS) emits toward and receives signals from the mobile telephones active in that cell (up to\
around 50). There are, for example, 30 000 BTS in France used by three networks. The carrier frequency varies from 400 to\
2100 MHz and the voice or data information is coded digitally either by frequency or phase modulation. Mobile telephones are\
two-way radio transmitters operating in the 400\'962100 MHz frequency range. In the GSM system, for example, the peak power\
emitted is 2 W, but the time-averaged power is always below 1/8 of this value, as power control reduces emission to the lowest\
level required. About half of the emitted power is absorbed by the user\'92s head, i.e., a maximum of 125 mW. Power absorption is\
expressed as specific absorption rate (SAR) in W kg1\
. New generation of smart phones include contemporarily a large number of\
communication protocols as GSM/GPRS/EDGE/UMTS/HSDPA/HSUPA/LTE spanning up to frequencies above 2450 MHz.\
Major improvements have been achieved in measuring the SAR in liquid phantoms and calculating power distribution in the\
head using numerical phantoms over the last 10 years. Today, the worst-case SAR associated with the average GSM phone on the\
market is ca. 0.5 W kg1\
, i.e., 1/4 of the recommended local-exposure limit value. It is now known with certainty that temperature\
increases in the brain periphery caused by the waves emitted by mobile telephones does not exceed 0.1 1C. As for smart phones,\
they are backward-compatible with older mobile phones networks, and usually operates with lower emissions than their precursors.\
As a result of current changes in usage \'96 increasing use of text and image messages and hands-free kits \'96 mobile telephones are\
less frequently placed against the ear. This dramatically reduces exposure of the tissues in the head.\
GSM base-station antennas have an emitting power of ca. 20 W. They are usually placed on rooftops and the emission beam is\
disc-shaped. Maximum exposure occurs on the ground, approximately 200 m from the BTS and it is almost zero at the bottom of\
the building or mast on which the antenna is mounted. Exposure of the public to the RFR emitted by base stations is typically\
1/10 000 of the recommended limit in terms of incident power. There is a consensus in the scientific community that base stations\
do not represent an health hazard.\
6 Biological Effects of Electromagnetic Fields\
Author's personal copy\
There is much scientific evidence, based on existing research, that warrants limiting exposure to high-level RFR due to the\
\'91thermal effects\'92 caused by heating of the tissues at SAR levels that correspond to a temperature elevation of a few degrees.\
However, this does not occur with mobile telephones. The search is thus for \'91non-thermal\'92 effects and most of the research activity\
has been aimed at defining the thresholds for these effects, with respect to existing exposure guidelines based on acute effects\
known to be due to heating.\
Health risk assessment associated with RF benefits from a database spanning over 50 years: the WHO and IEEE databases list\
about 2000 peer-reviewed publications, from biophysical theoretical analyses to human epidemiological studies. The EHC\
(Environmental Health criteria) Monograph by WHO, peer-reviewing all the literature on this subject from year 2000 is periodically realized.\
The carcinogenicity of RF EMFs was assessed by a working group at IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer),\
classifying them as \'91possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B),\'92 after the examination of the relevant human, animal and\
cellular studies, mainly due to limited epidemiological evidence. A causal link between RF exposure and increased risk of cancer\
was considered possible, but chance, bias or confounding factors could not be excluded.\
5.1 Cellular Models\
A number of replication studies that addressed some positive findings on enzyme activity, gene expression, and DNA alteration\
have all proven negative so far. A wide range of short-term, low-level in vitro experiments have shown that exposure did not cause\
cell death, implying that RF is not a toxic agent. Furthermore, the weight of evidence available today (induction of DNA strand\
breaks, chromosome aberrations, micronuclei formation, DNA repair synthesis, sister chromatid exchange, and phenotypic\
mutation) supports the conclusion that RF is not genotoxic. However, the synergy of RF with chemical agents or other physical\
agents still needs further investigation.\
Weak evidence is reported that RFR activates a stress response or production of ROS (free radicals) in human and animal cells\
under non-thermal conditions. The same outcome was evidenced about HSP (Heat Shock Proteins) production, cell proliferation,\
or apoptosis.\
A few studies reported positive findings, often reversible, and linked to critical physical exposure parameters such as modulation, frequency and power \'91windows,\'92 field polarization, or background ELF fields.\
5.2 Animal Models\
A large number of animal experiments have been performed over the past 50 years, using various frequencies and modulations. It\
is clear from these data that the vast majority of the reported biological effects are due to heating. These effects result either from a\
rise in tissue or body temperature exceeding 1 1C or in physiological and behavioral responses aimed at minimizing the total\
heat load.\
Major improvements in exposure system design have made it possible to better characterize the SAR within the organism, and\
allow for either local exposure that mimics mobile telephone use (e.g., loop antenna, carousel) or whole-body exposure related to\
base-stations (e.g., Ferry\'92s wheel, reverberation chamber, circular waveguide).\
Results on most of the non-cancer endpoints have been negative (memory, EEG, hearing, etc.) except for data on the permeability of the blood\'96brain barrier, which was found to be increased by two research groups but not by several others.\
Therefore, most of the major ongoing studies deal with cancer models. All of the long-term bioassays or sensitized studies have\
given negative results except for one using transgenic mice, genetically modified to increase the background incidence of lymphomas; an increased tumor incidence was found following GSM exposure. Most of more recent studies have not produced any\
persuasive evidence that RF fields are carcinogenic, even if a long-term low-level GSM exposure was reported to shorten life-span in\
rats, and increased lung tumor development was showed in mice co-treated with UMTS fields and chemical carcinogens during\
gestation and after weaning, such studies requiring confirmation. A large NTP (National Toxicology Program) study is ongoing,\
and unresolved questions about studies design and interpretation of results should be clarified through this study.\
A number of studies on animals ranging from focus on learning and memory, on behavior, biochemical brain responses,\
sensory organs, neurogenesis, and cytotoxicity, to neurodegenerative diseases have been carried out. Different endpoints have been\
studied at various SAR-levels in both mice and rats. The few positive findings appears inconsistent and mostly at levels well above\
guideline values.\
Since the issue that children are more sensitive than adults to the wireless telephones associated emissions has recently set in,\
important and well designed investigations of RF effects on pregnancy outcome, development of the offspring, and immunological\
parameters have been performed in the last years. Although one study suggested an association between early postnatal exposure\
and accelerated maturity in male rats, the evidence does not indicate that prenatal or early postnatal exposures are linked to acute\
adverse responses or the development of long-term harmful changes.\
5.3 Human Studies\
In spite of the obvious limitations of human experiments in terms of endpoints and exposure characterization, several investigations have been performed using various models. Findings have either been negative or difficult to replicate (sleep, EEG,\
cognitive functions, etc.).\
Biological Effects of Electromagnetic Fields 7\
Author's personal copy\
No unequivocal increased risk of brain tumors, head and neck tumors, or other malignant diseases has been indicated by\
epidemiological studies on RF EMF exposure. Great interest regarding an increased risk of glioma and acoustic neuroma in heavy\
users (corresponding, as in the IARC 2013 Monograph, to half an hour of daily use over years or more) of mobile phones derived\
from early studies. Based on the most recent cohort and incidence time trend studies, it appears that the evidence for an increased\
risk of glioma became weaker while the possibility of an association with acoustic neuroma remains open.\
Inconsistent results have been showed by neuro-physiological studies on possible effects on brain function in humans,\
including macrostructure of sleep, electroencephalography (EEG), event-related potentials, slow brain potentials, cognition, as\
well as regional blood flow and oxygenation changes. Although the associated biological mechanism and significance are still\
unclear, the former evidence that RF exposure may affect brain activities, as for EEG studies during wake and sleep state, is further\
supported by more recent studies. Overall, there is evidence that exposure to RF fields does not cause symptoms or affect cognitive\
function in humans.\
Clearly, the main issue today is the potential greater sensitivity of children to mobile phone emissions. Their lifetime exposure,\
the fact that their CNS is still developing, and, possibly, increased RF absorption in the head, have led to concerns that cannot be\
easily resolved through laboratory investigations and numerical modeling. A large Danish study has reported results that suggest\
higher prevalence of some behavioral and health disorders in children. About that, some considerations must be taken into\
account: results are not confirmed in other studies; some methodological weaknesses are present; the exposure indicators such as\
frequency of mother\'92s mobile phone use could not at all be relevant for fetal exposure in utero; attention deficit disorders have a\
clear hereditary component. By and large, the evidence for an association between behavioral disorders and RF exposure of the\
fetus is considered weak.\
Few studies have investigated the possibility that exposure to low-level RF fields from mobile phones and other sources can\
affect male fertility, but none of the recent studies are particularly informative.\
5.4 Conclusions\
RFR can cause biological effects when exposure is sufficiently intense: possible injuries include cataracts, skin burns, deep burns,\
heat exhaustion, and heat stroke. They are mostly due to heating. There have been scattered reports of effects that do not appear to\
be due to temperature elevation: the \'91non-thermal\'92 effects. None of these effects have been independently replicated, and most\
have no obvious consequence to human health. Furthermore, there are no known biophysical mechanisms that suggest that such\
effects could occur.\
Following the very rapid development of mobile telephony, a major research effort has been carried out worldwide (tens of\
millions of euros per year). Europe is most active (UK, Germany, Italy, and Finland, in particular), but many research groups are\
contributing from Japan, US, and Australasia.\
Most governments have addressed the issue of mobile telephony and health and several international and national expert\
committees have written accurate summaries of current knowledge (see the list of the most recent reports in the \'91Further Reading\'92\
section). Their conclusions converge toward an absence of health effects related to mobile telephones, but all encourage continuing research in some areas.\
In answer to the question: \'91mobile telephony: is there evidence of harm?\'92 one must conclude that the weight of scientific\
evidence does not support health concerns or indicate any health risk from mobile phones in normal use, nor that there is any\
accepted mechanism for potential health effects at the low levels associated with these devices. Findings to date, including\
epidemiological studies and laboratory studies of animals exposed both short-term and for their entire lifetimes, have not\
provided evidence that exposure causes cancer, or affects biological tissues in a manner that might lead to, or augment, any disease.\
However, some pending issues as the potentially greater sensitivity of children has been addressed using in vivo models as well as\
epidemiological investigations also still ongoing.\
6 Medical Applications\
Recently the therapeutic use of EMF in various medical applications has raised much attention within the scientific community.\
The deep description of the effects and application of EMF in this area of research and clinics is beyond the scope of this article,\
even if some fundamental effect, as the ones related to RF or MW heating, nervous system stimulation and electrical membrane\
polarization to induced electroporation has been also previously discussed.\
7 Occupational Exposures\
Directive 2013/35/UE of June 26, 2013 on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the\
risks arising from physical agents (EMFs) covers all known direct biophysical effects and other indirect effects caused by EMFs.\
However, the Directive currently only addresses short-term effects and does not concern possible long-term effects.\

8 Health Risk Assessment\
The process of health risk assessment by bodies such as ICNIRP (International Commission on Non-ionizing Radiation Protection), IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer), and WHO relies\
heavily on judging the quality of investigations. As stated above, the quality of exposure systems has greatly improved and can\
now be considered adequate. The use of well-grounded experimental protocols (sham-exposure, blinding of exposure and biological tests, positive controls) has become generalized. Moreover, it is now common practice in the field of bioelectromagnetics to\
ascertain that any positive results are replicated in at least one independent laboratory. In spite of these improvements, it should\
be noted that only a few top-level biology laboratories have engaged in this type of research, partly due to interferences created by\
societal and media pressure.\
Within its EMF International Programme, WHO has reviewed the science and issued research recommendations. The main\
conclusion from these reviews is that EMF exposures below the limits recommended in the ICNIRP guidelines do not appear to\
have any known impact on health. However, there are still some key gaps in knowledge requiring further research to provide\
definitive health risk assessments are provided by the World Health Organization within the EMF Project and published into a\
dedicated Research Agenda.\
Remaining uncertainties in the science database have led to pressure to introduce precautionary measures until gaps in\
knowledge are filled. If precautionary measures are introduced to reduce RFR levels, it is recommended that they should be\
voluntary and that health-based exposure limits be mandated to protect public health.\
