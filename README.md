*Topic constellations for corpus mapping and comparison*
This repository aims to serve two endpoints in the developmnet on an R&D instrument which charts the development of socio-cultural systems as reflected in the conversation around an anticipated 5G network:
1. *** maintain a database of a mythological corpus as seen documents for training a model and a technology corpus as unseen documents for testing ***
2. *** use a BERT-LDA model to derive topic clusters from mythological corpus and map the tech corpus to predicted topics (model source code attributed to Steve Shao https://blog.insightdatascience.com/contextual-topic-identification-4291d256a032 )***
